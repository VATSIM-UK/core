# About

Core is the flagship application of VATSIM UK. Originally designed to handle Single Sign-On (SSO) for our other applications, it now serves as the main hub for all member information and any new features we introduce.

# Issue Tracking

Development tasks (new features, technical tasks, bugs, etc.) should be tracked and actioned using JIRA, at [https://vatsimuk.atlassian.net/browse/CORE](https://vatsimuk.atlassian.net/browse/CORE). All current issues are publicly visible, however in order to create issues, you will need to [sign up](https://vatsimuk.atlassian.net/login).

When submitting an issue, please:
* Search the issue tracker before you submit your issue, as it may already be present.
* Provide as much information as possible, to ensure others are able to understand and act upon the information you provide.

To start work on an issue, post a comment on the issue requesting it be assigned to you. Once it has been assigned, you are free to start work on it.

# Deploying Locally

To deploy core locally, we have provided a pre-configured Vagrantfile based on the [laravel/homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/homestead) Vagrant Box. We have then abstracted away a number of additional steps required into a series of scripts within this repository.

## Requirements

You will need Vagrant installed. [More Information](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

## Steps
_NOTE: These steps will only work on a Linux/Unix Machine_

* Execute `./vagrant.generateEnv.sh` to generate your local Application Environment Configuration. This script uses the `.env.example` file and will prompt you for inputs as required. When finished, you will have a new `.env` file in your repository root. If you need to update it, you can do this manually or run the script again and select `y` when prompted to use your existing `.env` file.
* Execute `./vagrant.deploy.sh` to download the `laravel/homestead` box, install the `hostsupdater` vagrant plugin and start up the box. Once the box is running it will run the postInstall actions and when complete, you should be able to navigate to the `APP_URL` (`vukcore.test` by default) in your browser and see a local version of core running.
