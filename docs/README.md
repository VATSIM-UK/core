# About

Core is the flagship application of VATSIM UK. Originally designed to handle Single Sign-On (SSO) for our other applications, it now serves as the main hub for all member information and any new features we introduce.

All current issues are publicly visible, however in order to create issues, you will need to [sign up](https://vatsimuk.atlassian.net/login).

When submitting an issue, please:
