# Contributing

VATSIM UK has a dedicated team who are members of the VATSIM UK staff team who are ultimately responsible for the upkeep and development of VATSIM UK systems. The team maintains a backlog of work outside of this repository, but issues of which open-source contributions are welcomed will be added under 'Issues' in this repository.
