                    <p>
                        Gatwick is one of the busiest airports on the VATSIM network. Before controlling it, we want to
                        ensure you have the knowledge you need to provide a good service to pilots and get the most from
                        your controlling session.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Step One</h4>
                    <p>
                        In order to control Gatwick Ground as an S1, you will need to first meet
                        the requirements outlined on this page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You must be a home member of the UK, be active on the controller roster, be rated as an S1
                        and have controlled for 50 hours on UK GMC or GMP positions.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Step Two</h4>
                    <p>
                        You will be given access to the 'Gatwick ADC | S1 Endorsement' course. This Moodle course covers
                        Gatwick specific procedures, radiotelephony, and local flight planning restrictions.
                        There is a quiz at the end of the course with a pass mark of 90% - you must pass this quiz to
                        proceed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you do not pass the quiz on your first attempt, there is a study period of seven days for you to
                        review the Moodle course and improve your knowledge before you try again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you have passed the quiz at the end of the Moodle course, you will be prompted to submit
                        another ticket to ATC TRAINING.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Step Three</h4>
                    <p>
                        One of our Gatwick mentors will take you onto the live network, on either EGKK_GND or EGKK_DEL, and
                        offer you hints and tips as you control You will also have the chance to ask any questions that you have.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is not a test and you will not pass or fail, rather it is an opportunity for you to practically
                        apply the skills and knowledge which you have learned through completing the Moodle course.<br>
                        You will do this until the mentor deems you ready for the Gatwick ground endorsement. Once granted
                        the endorsement, you will be able to control EGKK_GND and EGKK_DEL on the live network without
                        supervision.
