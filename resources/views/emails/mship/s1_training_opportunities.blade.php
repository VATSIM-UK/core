    <p>Congratulations on achieving your S1 ATC rating! Thank you for choosing our division to complete your ATC Training.</p>

    <p>Although your OBS-S1 training process is now complete, there is always more to learn! Our training programmes teach you the basics you need to pass the exams and provide a good service, but they can't tell you everything. A good controller is always looking to improve the service they provide! All of the materials you've used during the programme will remain available to you and are updated regularly, so please take the time to review them and keep your skills sharp.</p>

    <p>If you're interested in obtaining an AFIS/AGCS endorsement, you can get started by following the process outlined <a href="https://www.vatsim.uk/atc/endorsements#endorsement-afis">here</a>. If you're interested in training for your S2 rating, you can self enrol yourself onto the waiting list <a href="https://www.vatsim.uk/mship/waiting-lists">here</a> once eligible.</p>
    
    <p>Enjoy your new rating!</p>
