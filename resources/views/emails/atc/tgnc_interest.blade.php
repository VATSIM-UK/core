    <p>As part of an initiative to clear out our waiting lists for S1 Training, we are checking users to see if they are still interested in ATC training.</p>

    <p>If you are still interested in becoming a controller, please click below to confirm as such, but be aware that if I do not receive a reply within 7 days from today you will be removed from the waiting list, and the 'New Controller' training group.
        If this happens and you want to continue your ATC training with us, you will be placed at the bottom of the waiting list.</p>

    <p>We have a long waiting list and need to make sure that everyone on the list is actively seeking training. Members no longer actively seeking training can cause delays to other potential controllers lower down the waiting list.</p>
