                        VATSIM and VATSIM UK have a shared goal of making an online environment which serves the needs of
                        the flight simulation and virtual air traffic control community. Whilst maintaining the network, 
                        we also provide a place for you to have a chance to make friends all across the world or 
                        unwind with other people who share the same passion as you.

                        The rules outlined below offer guidance for using the VATSIM UK systems. Members are also subject

                        These rules are here as a guide which members of the community should follow. These rules protect 
                        our members but also it guides them in their behaviour so as to avoid moderation and retain access

                        However, VATSIM UK reserves the right to carry out any actions deemed necessary to enforce these 
                        Terms &amp Conditions, the policies of the division or the network more widely. Examples are (but not 
                        limited to) closing and/or removing any discussion or content that is unacceptable. This can be done 
                        regardless of whether the specific violation is covered in these Terms &amp Conditions.

                    <p>
                        Any member that is unsure of whether their actions would breach the Terms &amp Conditions, should use 
                        caution and consider whether a different approach would be appropriate.

                        Whilst the whole staff team do their best to ensure that the public use of our systems is a fun and 
                        safe medium, it is unrealistic to think we are able to vet 100% of all content posted. If you believe 
                        anything to be in violation of any of the Terms &amp Conditions, please use the appropriate reporting 
                        tools to bring it to our attention.

                        1.2 Moderators are those people assigned to enforce the terms outlined here. Moderators are 
                        appointed and removed at the sole discretion of the UK DSG and decisions regarding appoints/removals 
                        are non-discussable with members. Administrators and Network Supervisors may also take action
                        against individuals who are in breach of the Code of Conduct, the Code of Regulations or
                        the User Agreement. They are appointed centrally by VATGOV9 (Vice President of Network 
                        Supervisors) or the Founders.

                        1.3 Any verbal or written message via a channel or private message (PM), sent on any platform 
                        that is owned and/or operated by VATSIM UK, that is believed to be in breach of the Terms &amp 
                        Conditions, should be brought to the attention of the Moderation Team. This is done by contacting
                        the moderation team as detailed above.. Some systems that we own and/or operate have built in 
                        reporting systems. Where these exist, they should be used in the first instance, prior to submitting 
                        an email. Members that take matters into their own hands will be treated accordingly and may 
                        themselves be subject to moderation.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                        1.4 Some mediums that we own and/or operate can be highly dynamic due to the pace of discussion.
                        It can be very easy to forget the wider audience which can follow the conversation. Everyone using 
                        these mediums is advised:
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                        1.4a Several thousand people may be able to read what you post or send, including members of the
                        age of 13. Also, the readers include those members who come from the minorities of our community 
                        and those people who joined the division today.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                        1.4b Popular mediums of communication act as a shop window for the division to show the world 
                        which values we hold and how we want our community to look.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                        1.4c Where conversation happens at pace, moderation in these mediums may be swift, decisive 
                        and be used to defuse inappropriate content or discussions from spiralling out of control. 
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                        1.5 Members shall not post defamatory comments about specific individuals on any VATSIM UK 
                        services. There are ways and means of dealing with these problems and publicly slandering 
                        the individuals concerned is not the correct way. Any member found to be doing this, 
                        regardless of the medium, will be disciplined as outlined in the group 3 offences section 
                        of these Terms &amp Conditions
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                        1.6 Moderators may remove content in breach of the Terms &amp Conditions.  In this case,
                        the moderator will make reasonable efforts to inform the member of the action taken. This
                        may contain either a written reason from the moderator explaining the removal or the Terms
                        &amp Conditions clause that has been broken will be put in its place. This can sometimes 
                        be less straight-forward to achieve, depending on the medium used. Where content has 
                        been removed, without further action , there is no right to appeal, although it is 
                        subject to on-going review by the team.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                        1.7 Where a member has broken the Terms &amp Conditions seriously and intentionally, 
                        they may have their access to all VATSIM UK services removed for a specific amount 
                        of time. In this instance, the member will be notified by email informing them of 
                        the reasons for removal.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                        If a member feels that disciplinary action brought upon themselves was unfair or 
                        unjust, they must contact the moderation team as detailed above. A member shall be 
                        notified of the outcome of their appeal within 5 days of the appeal being submitted.
                        Once an outcome has been given and the member notified, there is no further 
                        right to appeal and the decision of the appeal is final. Public discussion of any
                        appeals is an automatic right for removal.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                        1.8 VATSIM UK reserves the right to modify and change the Terms &amp Conditions at any point
                        without prior warning. Members will be notified when a change to the Terms &amp Conditions
                        occurs.
                    </p>

                        1.9 VATSIM UK is primarily an organisation for the promotion and delivery of an online network 
                        of pilots and air traffic controllers. All of the staff team wish to spend the minimum 
                        amount of time on moderation and issues of discipline, and the maximum amount of time making 
                        the division and the wider network a better place. We can only do this with the support of
                        the community in how its members choose to communicate with one another.

                        Whilst we encourage members to add a personal flair to their accounts by having a custom 
                        signature in which they can express themselves; we ask that members ensure they exceed 
                        no more than 4 lines of text. A member’s signature will be removed entirely if in 
                        breach of this rule.

                        In addition the limit on the number of lines allowed in a signature, members are asked to ensure
                        that when placing images in their signature, they do not exceed a cumulative width of 450 pixels
                        and a cumulative height of 160 pixels. A member&rsquo;s signature will be removed entirely if in

                        In the forum, threads containing large images or a large number of images should be labelled

                        channel for screenshots. The use of GIFs is broadly discouraged. As a medium, this is 
                        highly likely to result in a difference of understanding between members. There may 
                        be implied (deliberate or accidental) secondary meanings also.

                        aviation or the network. Staff members may advise individuals where topics are irrelevant 
                        for discussion in this medium or where a better channel exists for this topic. Failing to

                        our community should be free of profanity and vulgar language. If the offence is a 
                        fleeting verbal use of unacceptable language you may be subject to this term. If you post 
                        content containing unacceptable language (or links containing such content) you

                        All new threads belong somewhere. Therefore, when starting a new thread, decide which forum it
                        is best suited in and post it there and only there. If after posting a topic you believe it is
                        better suited elsewhere, simply use the &ldquo;report topic/post&rdquo; icon and request that a
                        moderator moves your topic to the more appropriate forum. By following this guideline, you can
                        help to keep our forums clean &amp; tidy and ensure that we do not waste our donated resources
