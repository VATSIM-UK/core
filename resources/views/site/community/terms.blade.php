                        VATSIM and VATSIM UK have a goal of providing an online environment which serves the needs of
                        the flight simulation and virtual air traffic control community. Whilst maintaining the network,
                        we also provide somewhere for you to have a chance to make friends all across the world or
                        generally unwind with other people who share the same passion as you.

                    <p>
                        The rules outlined below offer guidance for using the VATSIM UK systems. These rules are here as
                        a concrete framework which members of the community should conform to whilst participating.
                        These rules not only protect the members of this community from malicious abuse or annoyances,
                        but also it protects them from over moderation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In addition to this, VATSIM UK reserve the right to carry out any actions deemed necessary to
                        enforce these terms and conditions. Examples are (but not limited to) closing and/or deleting
                        any thread, post, and/or signature that is deemed unacceptable for any reason, regardless of
                        whether the specific violation is listed in the terms and conditions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Any member that is unsure of whether their actions would breach the Terms and Conditions, should
                        use caution and consider whether a different approach would be appropriate.

                        Whilst the Community department do their best to ensure that the public use of our systems is a
                        constructive and safe medium, it is unrealistic to think we are able to vet 100% of all content
                        posted. Therefore if you believe anything to be in violation of any of the Terms &amp;
                        Conditions, please use the appropriate reporting tools to bring it to our attention.

                        better suited elsewhere, simply use the &ldquo;report topic/post&rdquo; icon and request that a
                        moderator moves your topic to the more appropriate forum. By following this guideline, you can
