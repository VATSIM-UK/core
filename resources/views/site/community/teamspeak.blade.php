                            On our pages you will find everything you ever needed to know about how to become a virtual
                            Air Traffic Controller or online pilot. However, that is not always enough. Sometimes it is
                            far quicker, far easier and much more fun to actually speak to someone direct The VATSIM UK
                            TeamSpeak server may just resolve that for you.

                            VATSIM UK hosts a TeamSpeak server which is available to members 24 hours a day, 7 days a
                            week. It is an essential tool for co-ordinating with adjacent controllers, mentoring
                            sessions, enjoying group flights together or simply having a chat. It is a great resource
                            which is well used by the division. And best of all, like all other VATSIM services, it&#39;s
                            completely free.
