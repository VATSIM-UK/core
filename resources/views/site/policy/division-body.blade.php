## Section 2 | Network Use

### 2.1 Controller Positions

2.1.a Controllers providing services in the UK Division must only staff positions authorised by the
Operations Department and shall do so in accordance with published local procedures.

2.1.b Area Control (CTR) positions available for general use are defined in the relevant London or Scottish
‘vMATS Part 2’.

2.1.c Oceanic Control (CTR/FSS) positions available for general use are defined by the Oceanic Control
Procedures documentation for the Shanwick FIR.

2.1.d Approach and Aerodrome positions (DEL, GND, TWR and APP) suitable for general use are defined in
Operations Department Documentation. Where an aerodrome is undocumented or marked as out
of date, available positions can be clarified by the UK sector file produced by the Operations
Department.

2.1.d(i) Unless specified in active Operations Department documentation, more than one APP
position at a single Aerodrome shall not be opened unless an underlying TWR position is
online.

2.1.e Temporary positions may be published for the purpose of events, or other special circumstance
when authorised by the Operations Department. This may include the authorisation of positions
that do not provide top-down (GCAP 4.6(c)).

2.1.f The following prefixes are reserved for UK Area Control: EGGX, EGPX, EGVV, SCO, STC, SCL, MPC,
MAN, EGTT, LON and LTC.

### 2.2 Connecting

2.2.a Controllers shall only utilise callsigns and frequencies approved for use by the Operations
Department.

2.2.b To allow coordination, connected controllers must log onto a server/software nominated by the UK
Division unless they are unable to do so.

2.2.c Controllers connecting to observe shall log on with one of the following formats:
- XX_OBS / XXX_OBS / EGZZ_OBS - approved for use by all members (where X and Z are
    replaced as defined). Members shall preferably log in displaying initials in place of ‘X’
    (e.g. XX_OBS), though may use the ICAO that they are observing, replacing Z (i.e.
    EGZZ_OBS)
- XX_INS / XXX_INS – approved for use only be members holding an Instructor Rating issued
    by VATSIM UK. When using this format, instructors shall log in with their (recognisable)
    initials.
- VATUK – Callsigns containing VATUK are restricted to Division Staff as outlined in 1.2.e.

2.2.d Controllers taking over a position using the published callsign shall utilise an additional underscore
(_) prior to the final suffix to make the position recognisable to pilots. (e.g. EGLL_N_APP becomes
EGLL_N__APP) unless an alternative is published by the Operations Department.

2.2.e Mentors must connect with a callsign associated with their student. A Mentor can only supervise a
single frequency.

2.2.e(i) Students and mentors shall utilise callsign conventions specified in ATC Training Department
policy.

2.2.f Controllers shall operate on a single frequency. Cross-coupling of frequencies is permitted for 10
minutes or less to facilitate the opening/closing of frequencies or short breaks in an underlying
frequency. Exceptions to this may be granted in Operations Department documentation or
temporary procedures.

2.2.f(i) Area Controllers may cross-couple two or more frequencies for a longer period where
required to retain pilots with the correct controller.

### 2.3 Permission to Control

2.3.a The VATSIM UK website ‘roster’ stipulates what a member can control and is amalgamated from
Division, Training, Visiting/Transferring and Global Policy. If the roster does not list a member as
able to control a position, they shall not log on.

2.3.a(i) To remain ‘current’ on the roster, home controllers shall have controlled at least 3 hours on
UK positions within each calendar quarter. Exceptions to this rule may be published for those
gaining permission to control within the calendar quarter.

2.3.a(ii) Where a controller is subject to the removal of controlling permissions under GCAP 9.1, they
shall not log on to positions which they have been restricted from operating.

2.3.b Criteria for all Endorsements shall be published by the ATC Training Department, either on the
VATSIM UK website, or in ATC Training Department policy.

2.3.c During an ATC Mentoring session, validation or practical exam (hereafter ‘ATC Training Session’), the
express permission of the mentor/validator/examiner (hereafter referred to as ‘Assessor’) must be
obtained before:
- A split of an underlying Ground/Delivery (GND/DEL) is opened during a Ground or Tower
    ATC Training Session.
- A split of an underlying Tower (TWR) is opened during a Tower ATC Training Session
- A split of an Approach (APP) position is opened during an Approach ATC Training Session
- A split of the student’s Area Sector is opened during an Area ATC Training Session.

2.3.d During a validation or practical exam, the Assessor must give permission for any student on a solo
endorsement or a student receiving mentoring to control an adjacent position. ATC Training
Department Policy may specify further requirements before the Assessor can grant this permission.

2.3.e For controlling during an event, a suitable member of the ATC Training Department responsible for a
student’s training and a suitable member of the Operations Department responsible for events must
give permission for:
- Students with a solo endorsement to control event positions
- Training sessions to be conducted on event positions

2.3.f Flow Management Positions (suffix _FMP) are implemented in the UK. Members must be
individually authorised to open these callsigns by the Operations Department.

2.3.f(i) Members designated as ‘Flow Managers’ by the Operations Departments may utilise any
suitable area prefix with the FMP suffix. (e.g. LON_FMP)

2.3.f(ii) Members partaking in traffic planning can be authorised by the Operations Department to
use Flow Management callsigns. Authorisation will be via a specific notice, or via an approved
event roster. These members must always log on with an ICAO code followed by the FMP
suffix, even if covering multiple airports (e.g. EGLL_FMP).

2.3.f(iii) Permission to use Flow Management Positions out of this context can be approved by the
Operations Director, though must be suitably announced.

### 2.4 Bookings and Reservations

2.4.a A booking displayed on the VATSIM UK website reserves a position during the time specified. Any
other ‘bookings’ are not valid.

2.4.a(i) A controller is only permitted to make a booking if they are currently allowed to control that
position and will be allowed to do so at the time booked.

2.4.a(ii) A controller shall hand over and vacate a position if a member with a valid booking arrives to
take over.

2.4.a(iii) A standard booking is rendered invalid if the member is 15 minutes or more late logging on,
or if they voluntarily log off before the end of the booking time.

2.4.a(iv) A booking for a mentoring session is rendered invalid if the student does not log onto the
position within 30 minutes of the booked start time. A mentor may choose to log on before
30 minutes and utilise the booking as their own.

2.4.a(v) An exam or validation booking remains valid for the entire period booked. Where required to
satisfy examination criteria, the booking may be extended at the discretion of the primary
examiner.

2.4.a(vi) A booking for a mentoring session, exam or validation shall take priority over all standard
bookings. When overriding an existing booking, all efforts should be made to inform the
holder of the existing booking at the earliest opportunity.

2.4.a(vii) During an exam or validation, and where required to satisfy examination requirements, the
primary examiner may direct a controller covering an underlying position to hand over and
vacate their position.

2.4.a(viii) Limits on number, frequency and duration of bookings may be implemented by the UK
Division to ensure bookings are not excessive. When an individual books excessively, they
may be restricted from booking, or bookings removed by the Division Staff Group or
delegated staff member.

2.4.b When a position split is opened (or planned to be), the earlier controller to book (or log on if no
bookings) may choose which split of the sector they wish to control regardless of their initial
position/booking.

2.4.b(i) A split is defined as any position at the same level (e.g. APP) that takes airspace/responsibility
from the previous controller.

2.4.c Area controllers controlling positions covering more than one Local Area Group (hereafter ‘LAG’)
should make bookings for a single LAG to indicate the sector to which 2.4.b applies.

2.4.c(i) Where no booking is made, controllers may log on to splits in any LAG so long as the original
controller remains controlling another whole LAG.

2.4.c(ii) Where logging on results in the initial controller covering less than a whole LAG, or a
controller intends to split the LAG booked by the original controller, the original controller
may choose the sector split they wish to control as in 2.4.b.

2.4.d During an official VATSIM UK event, the Operations Department’s Events Team shall determine
whether a controller roster is required. Where a roster is published, this shall override all controller
bookings.

2.4.d(i) A delegate of the Operations Department’s Events Team responsible for the roster is
permitted to make changes to the roster during an event, including removing controllers
from positions if required.

2.4.d(ii) Allocation of controlling positions during rostered events may be subject to a priority order
including but not limited to: rating, experience, training status, active mentoring and Division
status.

2.4.e Members who violate VATSIM UK booking rules, fail to honour their bookings or fail to attend their
rostered positions during events may be subject to sanctions. This may include losing the ability to
book and/or not being rostered for events.

### 2.5 Network Behaviour

2.5.a The ATC channel shall only be used for operational messages intended for multiple controllers.
Controllers must show consideration to users with larger visibility ranges and avoid choosing this
method of communication where it is not required.

2.5.b During a mentoring session, validation or practical exam, the assessor may decide to refuse an
emergency on behalf of their student under the same conditions set by the Code of Conduct.

2.5.c Pilots shall not initiate an emergency or diversion during a practical exam or validation without the
prior approval of the assessor.

### 2.6 Controller Performance

2.6.a Controlling permissions can be removed in accordance with GCAP Section 9. This process shall be
administered under the supervision of suitable members of the DSG.

2.6.b Where a member falls below the standard to control, feedback should be submitted to the Division
with detail of the issues witnessed.

2.6.c Where possible, controllers below the required standard should receive information and time to
improve. VATSIM UK fully endorses and applies the principle of GCAP 9.1.

2.6.d It shall be the responsibility of a controller to ensure they are improving to the required standard if
they are notified they are performing below it. VATSIM UK is not able to offer re-training to all rated
controllers but may do so on a case-by-case basis.

2.6.e A member of the DSG or an ATC Instructor with appropriate seniority relative to the position
controlled can request any Home Controller to disconnect if their performance is substantially
below the required standard that there has been prolonged poor service to pilots.

2.6.e(i) In all cases, request to disconnect is a significant action and consideration should always be
given to alternatives. Prior to asking a member to disconnect, attempts should be made to
seek a second opinion.

2.6.e(ii) An ATC Instructor has sufficient seniority to enact this clause if they are an Instructor at or
above the rating required to control the position, regardless of endorsements held.

2.6.e(iii) A DSG Member will have sufficient seniority to enact this clause as decided internally by the
DSG, guided by the ATC Training Director.

2.6.f Where a Visiting or Transferring Controller is substantially below the required standard to control a
member of the DSG or ATC Instructor with appropriate seniority relative to the position controlled
may require the controller to log off and seek clarification from the ATC Training Department before
reconnecting.

2.6.f(i) Appropriate seniority for this clause is considered the same as guided in 2.6.e.

2.6.g A request to vacate from 2. 6 .e and 2.6.f must be followed with a notification to the ATC Training
Department of the controlling witnessed. The ATC Training Department or a suitable working group
will then decide what further action shall be taken.

## Section 3. ATC Training and Examinations

### 3.1 Ratings Training

3.1.a Only Home Members can be trained for a new ATC rating. To be eligible for training a member must
have completed 50 hours consolidation on VATSIM UK control positions requiring their current
rating. British Overseas Territories that VATSIM UK has controlling agreements for are not counted.

3.1.a(i) A controller must have active status and permission to control unrestricted positions for their
current rating on the VATSIM UK Roster to receive ATC Training.
3.1.b S1, S2, S3 and C1 ratings require a theory exam and practical exam with a VATSIM UK examiner.

3.1.c Theory exams for ratings shall be GCAP compliant with the pass mark set by the ATC Training
Department. A member must complete the exam alone for the result to be valid.

3.1.c(i) After a first failure of a theory exam, the maximum (72 hour) cooling off period is applied.

3.1.c(ii) After any subsequent failure of a theory examination a minimum of 72 hours cooling off
period is applied. This cooling off period can be lengthened at the discretion of the ATC
Training Department.

3.1.c(iii) In cases of failure of the same exam of 3 or more times, the ATC Training Department has
discretion to arrange an alternate theory exam (even if the member subsequently passes),
where it is deemed the member has seen too great a percentage of the question bank.

3.1.d The award of the S1 rating in the UK Division occurs after full theory and partial practical assessment
of the GCAP Developing Controller criteria and therefore the S2 training programme is subject to
GCAP 8.3(b). Developing Controller practical competencies are assessed as part of the S2 practical
exam process.

3.1.d(i) This may be through combined or separate practical assessments, as defined by ATC Training
Department Policy.

3.1.d(ii) Assessment of these competencies as part of the S2 process must be performed by an
Examiner able to examine to the S2 level.

3.1.e The C3 rating criteria are defined in the ATC Training Department Policy.

3.1.f The ATC Training Department may define where training and examinations can occur for an ATC
rating and is not obliged to provide training at a location requested by the trainee.

3.1.f(i) A training location may be stipulated for a member based on their training history or
controlling experience.

3.1.f(ii) Trainees may be moved during training to another location where the ATC Training
Department deems it suitable.

### 3.2 Training Processes

3.2.a All training sessions must be accepted and displayed on the relevant portion of the VATSIM UK
website unless performed in accordance with an agreement approved by the ATC Training
Department and DSG.

3.2.b Approval to perform training sessions is granted by the ATC Training Department. No members shall
conduct a training session on a position they are not authorised.

3.2.b(i) To conduct a training session, a controller must be currently authorised to control the
position they are training and all positions potentially covered top-down.

3.2.c Students are required by the Division to put in sufficient effort to progress in all forms of training.
This includes self-directed learning outside of formal training sessions and controlling on the
network to remain fluent.

3.2.c(i) Trainees that do not put in sufficient effort towards their training progress may have their
training suspended.

3.2.c(ii) Where a trainee is identified as not making suitable progress given the mentoring resource
provided to them, the ATC Training Department may intervene. This may include stopping
training.

### 3.3 Solo Endorsements

3.3.a Solo endorsements are utilised for S2, S3 and C1 rating training and provided in accordance with
GCAP.

3.3.b Trainees provided with a solo endorsement can be restricted to splits of their training position or to
situations where suitable top-down cover is available.

## Section 4. Visiting & Transferring Controllers

### 4.1 Visiting & Transferring process

4.1.a The Visiting & Transferring Process shall be available as a separate policy or published on the
VATSIM UK website.

4.1.b Local Induction Plans shall be formulated by the ATC Training Department and shall involve a
Competency Check unless specifically waived.

4.1.c Visiting Controllers are not permitted to request status on Tier 1 positions until they have obtained
permission to control unrestricted at the relevant rating.

4.1.d Visiting Controllers may request status directly onto Tier 2 endorsement positions without needing
to be authorised to control unrestricted positions at the relevant rating. This may be permitted at
the discretion of the ATC Training Department.

4.1.e VATSIM UK shall limit the ATC Training resources it provides to visitors and transferees to prioritise
home controllers, as permitted by TVCP 6.2(b).

### 4.2 Visiting Controller Status

4.2.a Visiting Controllers are subject to the same activity requirements as home controllers, as defined
within 2.3.a(i). Visiting Controllers must meet these requirements to remain ‘current’ on the VATSIM
UK Roster.

4.2.a(i) A Visitor only able to provide services on Oceanic positions is not subject to the above
currency requirements.

4.2.b Visiting Controllers who lose currency and do not return to the VATSIM UK Roster within 6 months,
or who subsequently lose currency within a 2 year period of returning to the Roster, shall have their
visiting rights to control UK positions removed permanently, as permitted by TVCP 6.5(c).

4.2.b(i) Visiting Controllers with the ability to provide services on Oceanic positions will retain this
ability following the removal of visiting rights under 4.2.b, and will therefore only lose visiting
rights on ‘Domestic’ UK positions.

4.2.c Visiting Controllers may control during events, however the UK Division may give preference to
Home Members for where a controller roster is produced.

### 4.3 Area Control Restrictions

4.3.a Following an upgrade in permanent ATC rating from S3 to C1, Visiting Controllers will be required to
undertake a further Competency Check before approval to control Area Control positions in the UK
is granted, unless waived by the ATC Training Department.

4.3.b Visiting and Transferring Controllers approved to control a Area positions will initially be limited to a
single Local Area Group and expected to gain familiarity and experience prior to being permitted to
request a second Local Area Group.

4.3.c Once a Visiting or Transferring Controller has obtained suitable experience (which must include no
less than 10 hours controlling that Local Area Group), they may request to control an additional
Local Area Group. The ATC Training Department may require a single familiarisation session with an
approved mentor, or may waive this requirement.

4.3.c(i) The above process shall be repeated once the Visiting Controller has suitable experience on
their last permitted Local Area Group, or it may be waived at the discretion of the ATC
Training Department.

4.3.c(ii) A Transferring Controller that has obtained suitable experience on a second Local Area Group
shall have restrictions lifted and be permitted to control any unrestricted Area Control
positions.

4.3.d Regardless of whether a familiarisation session is provided, it is the controller’s responsibility to
ensure competency on the position and adherence with Operations Department Documentation.

4.3.d(i) Permission to control specific Local Area Group can be removed from a Visiting Controller
following negative feedback of their performance.

4.3.d(ii) Where a visiting controller has been removed from a Local Area Group due to their
performance, they shall not be permitted to request to control additional Local Area Groups.

## Section 5. Pilot Training

### 5.1 Status

5.1.a VATSIM UK Pilot Training Department (UK PTD) may hold Authorised Training Organisation status
with the Central Pilot Training Department (Central PTD). It may also conduct additional Pilot
Training courses outside the scope of Central PTD policies and procedures.

5.1.b Where ATO status is held:

5.1.b(i) The Pilot Training Director shall be the ATO Responsible Representative (RR).

5.1.b(ii) The Pilot Training Director shall designate the Chief Flight Instructor (CFI), which may be the
Pilot Training Director.

5.1.b(iii) The Pilot Training Director and not the Chief Flight Instructor shall appoint/designate a
Deputy Chief Flying Instructor if one is required.

5.1.c Staff can be appointed to the Pilot Training Department, to the ATO or to both.

5.1.c(i) Staff appointed to the ATO only are not subject to TVCP 6.1(f). VATSIM UK may therefore
appoint these staff without requiring them to transfer to the UK Division and without seeking
approval from their Division or Region.

5.1.c(ii) Staff appointed to the ATO only may still be listed on the VATSIM UK staff page, will have
access to appropriate VATSIM UK services to perform their duties and will be subject to the
same expectations and rules as Department staff. However, they are not permitted to
perform staff duties outside of the ATO remit.

### 5.2 Training Processes

5.2.a All training sessions must be accepted and displayed on the relevant portion of the VATSIM UK
website unless performed in accordance with an agreement approved by the Pilot Training
Department and DSG.

5.2.b Approval to perform mentoring sessions or exams (hereafter ‘pilot training sessions’) is granted by
the Pilot Training Department or ATO as relevant. No members shall conduct a training session on a
position they are not authorised.

## Section 6. Services

### 6.1 General

6.1.a VATSIM UK provides services accessed through a member’s VATSIM login credentials. These services
are governed in their use by global VATSIM policies and any additional Terms and Conditions
published by VATSIM UK

6.1.b The Division Director, or a nominated representative, shall appoint a Moderation Team for VATSIM
UK services.

6.1.b(i) Moderators are not considered staff by VATSIM UK and as such are not subject to TVCP
6.1(f).

6.1.c Access to any of the VATSIM UK systems may be temporarily removed or restricted by members of
the Moderation Team. Permanent removal of access must be approved by the DSG.

6.1.d No political material shall be displayed on any of the VATSIM UK services.
