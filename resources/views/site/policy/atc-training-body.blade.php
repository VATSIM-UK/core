### 4.3 Conduct

S2 and above exams shall be conducted on the live network and may either be pre-arranged or

ways is most suitable to conduct an exam:

- Practical exam scheduled in CTS;
- Student observed on solo validation;
- Student in mentoring session/end of block exam with examiner(s).

Where a mentoring session is used as a spontaneous exam, the examination criteria must be used to assess
the competency of the student. In this scenario, the mentoring session will be cancelled in CTS and a
practical exam will be accepted and associated report filed.

All ATC exams, either pre-arranged or spontaneous, must have an exam report filed no matter the outcome.

### 4.4 Grading & Assessment

**The overall grading will be as follows:**

- **Pass**
- **Incomplete** (direct continuation at a later date)
- **Fail - Resubmit** (where the exam has been assessed as a failure but the student requires no further
training)

**Individual criteria will be assessed as follows:**

- **Fully Competent** – Exceptional level of proficiency in the subject matter. Exceeded expected
standards and effectively applies knowledge to practical situations
- **Mostly Competent** – Good level of proficiency in the subject matter. Expected standards are met
