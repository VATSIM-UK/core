taking place as scheduled.

### 4.3 Conduct

S2 and above exams shall be conducted on the live network and may either be pre-arranged or
spontaneous. Spontaneous exams may only be conducted with the explicit approval, in advance, of the ATC
Training Director or ATC Training Manager. Examiners shall use their judgement as to which of the following
ways is most suitable to conduct an exam:

- Practical exam scheduled in CTS;
- Student observed on solo validation;
- Student in mentoring session/end of block exam with examiner(s).

Where a mentoring session is used as a spontaneous exam, the examination criteria must be used to assess
the competency of the student. In this scenario, the mentoring session will be cancelled in CTS and a
practical exam will be accepted and associated report filed.

All ATC exams, either pre-arranged or spontaneous, must have an exam report filed no matter the outcome.

### 4.4 Grading & Assessment

**The overall grading will be as follows:**

- **Pass**
- **Incomplete** (direct continuation at a later date)
- **Fail - Resubmit** (where the exam has been assessed as a failure but the student requires no further
training)

**Individual criteria will be assessed as follows:**

- **Fully Competent** – Exceptional level of proficiency in the subject matter. Exceeded expected
standards and effectively applies knowledge to practical situations
- **Mostly Competent** – Good level of proficiency in the subject matter. Expected standards are met
