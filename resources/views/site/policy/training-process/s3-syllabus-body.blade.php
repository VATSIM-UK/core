## Scope

This document outlines the Senior Student (S3) training syllabus for students training in VATSIM UK.

---

## Scope

This document is only to be used in conjunction with the S3 training scheme of the VATSIM UK Training Department and should never be adopted for real world use.

The information published by VATSIM UK within this document is made available without warranty of any kind; the Organization accepts no responsibility or liability whether direct or indirect, 
as to the currency, accuracy or quality of the information, nor for any consequence of its use.

## Introduction

The syllabus details the competencies and content covered by the S3 training course in VATSIM UK. Students will meet the learning objectives through independent study of material provided in eLearning courses and traditional documentation, supported by mentors and instructors in one-to-one and group teaching sessions. Students are encouraged to ask questions in the #app_students channel on Discord.

## Pre-Course Learning

In advance of students beginning a course of practical training, they are expected to have completed the relevant theory examination and attended a pre-course seminar, which will serve to provide the basis for theoretical knowledge to be developed upon during a course of practical training. VATSIM UK’s S3 Moodle course should form the basis for much of the theoretical knowledge required for the rating.

As is outlined in the relevant ATC Training Policy, completion of the S3 theory exam is a condition of the award of a training place. Should a prospective student fail to attend a pre-course seminar, they will be expected to recover their own theoretical knowledge before starting a practical training course.

The pre-course seminar will cover the following content:
- Course overview
    - Block structure
    - Course progression
    - Theoretical Requirements
- Needs, Hopes and Expectations
    - Expectations of students
    - Requirements to stay current
- Supporting Documentation
    - MATS Part 1
    - vMATS
    - CAP413
    - Discord Training Fora     
    - S3 Moodle Course
    - Mentoring Reports
- Equipment and Systems
    - Euroscope Radar Display
    - Topsky
    - Tags and Lists
    - Leader Lines
- Standing Agreements
    - Introduction to Standing Agreements
    - Inbound Releases

## Syllabus
This section serves to outline the competencies required of an S3 controller within VATSIM UK and aims to explain the requirements of each competency. Insofar as is possible, this section should be considered exhaustive; it should not be required that a student receiving training towards an S3 rating in VATSIM UK demonstrate any skills beyond those which are listed in this section of this document.     

### Block Training

S3 Training now incorporates block training as a way to standardise the Approach Radar training process and ensure a graduated approach to student training.  This ensures that the syllabus is covered appropriately whilst minimising the risk of student overwhelm.

Students should complete all blocks before being forwarded for a practical exam unless otherwise agreed with the training administrators (TGI, ATC TM, ATC TD). The block training system comprises of two blocks; students are only taught competencies in their block until completing the content of each and then they complete the end of block exam.

#### Block One

Block one aims to introduce student controllers to the basic concept of approach radar control. A student controller should, at the end of this block, be expected to demonstrate:
- An understanding of the role of an approach radar controller.
    - How to plan, at a basic level, a sequence for arrivals.
    - The responsibilities of an approach radar controller.
    - How to contact aircraft from unmanned airspace.
    - How to manage their workload, including how to prioritise aircraft and manage their workload on a top-down basis.
- Radar and Communication usage
    - How to set up Euroscope and interpret the radar display.
    - How to appropriately manage tags and lists.
    - How to set up and use the radar display, including relevant features of TopSky and UKCP.
    - The Identification, Verification and Validation process, including likely Tag errors and Euroscope issues.
- Basic local knowledge
    - The various classes of airspace and the responsibilities of controllers and pilots within each class.
    - The structure of the local airspace, including the airspace that the controller is directly responsible for and adjacent blocks of airspace owned by neighbouring sectors, to include the RMA or local area and any adjacent controlled airspace.
    - The ownership of blocks of airspace, including lateral and vertical constraints imposed on the student controller.
    - General knowledge of the APC section of the vMATS, including:
        - Definition of the local airspace, commensurate with the above.
        - The definition of local holding points, including their vertical constraints.
        - Basic conditions for releases.
        - Expectations for controlling departing aircraft.
        - Standing agreements for spacing of arriving aircraft.
- Radiotelephony 
    - The use of correct phraseology, focused on the handling of IFR traffic.
    - Frequency presence and management, including communication priority.
- Vectoring, descent management, separation and spacing.
    - Techniques to maintain separation.
    - Understanding Separation Standards, where the standards are derived from and when they can be applied.
    - When and how to use Speed Control, understanding the use of ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ speeds and the impact of ‘compression’.
    - Understanding the definitions of ‘separation’ and ‘spacing’ alongside standard spacing requirements for various airfields.
- Establishing Aircraft on Approaches
    - Establishing aircraft on ILS approaches.
    - Establishing aircraft on RNP approaches.
    - Establishing aircraft on other instrument approaches.
    - Establishing aircraft on Visual Approaches.
- Co-ordination
    - Receiving or negotiating Inbound Releases and understanding the implications of various release types.
    - Understanding the ‘PRAWNS’ pneumonic to facilitate controller handovers.
    - Working split positions (INT/FIN splits).

#### Block Two

Block two aims to develop on the knowledge obtained at Block One, whilst introducing more advanced concepts for streaming arriving aircraft, managing continuous descent approaches, managing holds and providing UK Flight Information Services. A student controller should, at the end of this block, be expected to demonstrate:

- The consolidation of skills and knowledge obtained at Block One.
- How to efficiently and safely sequence aircraft, considering:
    - How to establish an appropriate landing order for arrivals.
    - The facilitation of Continuous Descent Approaches when appropriate.
    - How to build streams of traffic, including merging streams of traffic from multiple terminal holds.
    - Planning for accommodating wake vortex separation.
    - Accommodating missed approaches.
    - Handling departures and their interactions with inbound aircraft.
- Hold management, including:
    - Entry and exit from the hold.
    - Descending aircraft within the hold.
    - Hold management, preparation and co-ordination.
- The provision of UK Flight Information Services, including:
    - Handling aircraft joining, crossing and leaving controlled airspace, facilitating appropriate service upgrades and downgrades.
    - The provision of Basic and Traffic services.
    - The provision of Deconfliction services with consideration to limitations of the service.
    - The provision of Radar Handovers to adjacent ATSUs.
- Final preparation for the S3 exam.

## Lessons Plans

In order to ensure that students beginning their S3 training are brokered to the syllabus in a consistent manner, the department requires that students are generally taken through a number of pre-determined lesson plans. Whilst these lesson plans provide a set structure for training, they may, at the discretion of the mentor, be condensed, replaced or re-ordered, depending on an individual students approach to training. 

### Lesson One
