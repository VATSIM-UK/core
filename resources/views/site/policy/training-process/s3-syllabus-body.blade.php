# Syllabus and Lesson Plans

**Version 1.0**  
**Effective Date:** 2nd February 2026

---

## Scope

This document outlines the Senior Student (S3) training syllabus for students training in VATSIM UK.

---

## Exclusion of Liability

This document is only to be used in conjunction with the S3 training scheme of the VATSIM UK Training Department and should never be adopted for real world use.

The information published by VATSIM UK within this document is made available without warranty of any kind; the Organization accepts no responsibility or liability whether direct or indirect, 
as to the currency, accuracy or quality of the information, nor for any consequence of its use.

## Introduction

The syllabus details the competencies and content covered by the S3 training course in VATSIM UK. Students will meet the learning objectives through independent study of material provided in eLearning courses and traditional documentation, supported by mentors and instructors in one-to-one and group teaching sessions. Students are encouraged to ask questions in the #app_students channel on Discord.

---
    
## Pre-Course Learning

In advance of students beginning a course of practical training, they are expected to have completed the relevant theory examination and attended a pre-course seminar, which will serve to provide the basis for theoretical knowledge to be developed upon during a course of practical training. VATSIM UK’s S3 Moodle course should form the basis for much of the theoretical knowledge required for the rating.

As is outlined in the relevant ATC Training Policy, completion of the S3 theory exam is a condition of the award of a training place. Should a prospective student fail to attend a pre-course seminar, they will be expected to recover their own theoretical knowledge before starting a practical training course.

The pre-course seminar will cover the following content:
- Course overview
    - Block structure
    - Course progression
    - Theoretical Requirements
- Needs, Hopes and Expectations
    - Expectations of students
    - Requirements to stay current
- Supporting Documentation
    - MATS Part 1
    - vMATS
    - CAP413
    - Discord Training Fora     
    - S3 Moodle Course
    - Mentoring Reports
- Equipment and Systems
    - Euroscope Radar Display
    - Topsky
    - Tags and Lists
    - Leader Lines
- Standing Agreements
    - Introduction to Standing Agreements
    - Inbound Releases

## Syllabus
This section serves to outline the competencies required of an S3 controller within VATSIM UK and aims to explain the requirements of each competency. Insofar as is possible, this section should be considered exhaustive; it should not be required that a student receiving training towards an S3 rating in VATSIM UK demonstrate any skills beyond those which are listed in this section of this document.     

### Block Training

S3 Training now incorporates block training as a way to standardise the Approach Radar training process and ensure a graduated approach to student training.  This ensures that the syllabus is covered appropriately whilst minimising the risk of student overwhelm.

Students should complete all blocks before being forwarded for a practical exam unless otherwise agreed with the training administrators (TGI, ATC TM, ATC TD). The block training system comprises of two blocks; students are only taught competencies in their block until completing the content of each and then they complete the end of block exam.

### Block One

Block one aims to introduce student controllers to the basic concept of approach radar control. A student controller should, at the end of this block, be expected to demonstrate:
- An understanding of the role of an approach radar controller.
    - How to plan, at a basic level, a sequence for arrivals.
    - The responsibilities of an approach radar controller.
    - How to contact aircraft from unmanned airspace.
    - How to manage their workload, including how to prioritise aircraft and manage their workload on a top-down basis.
- Radar and Communication usage
    - How to set up Euroscope and interpret the radar display.
    - How to appropriately manage tags and lists.
    - How to set up and use the radar display, including relevant features of TopSky and UKCP.
    - The Identification, Verification and Validation process, including likely Tag errors and Euroscope issues.
- Basic local knowledge
    - The various classes of airspace and the responsibilities of controllers and pilots within each class.
    - The structure of the local airspace, including the airspace that the controller is directly responsible for and adjacent blocks of airspace owned by neighbouring sectors, to include the RMA or local area and any adjacent controlled airspace.
    - The ownership of blocks of airspace, including lateral and vertical constraints imposed on the student controller.
    - General knowledge of the APC section of the vMATS, including:
        - Definition of the local airspace, commensurate with the above.
        - The definition of local holding points, including their vertical constraints.
        - Basic conditions for releases.
        - Expectations for controlling departing aircraft.
        - Standing agreements for spacing of arriving aircraft.
- Radiotelephony 
    - The use of correct phraseology, focused on the handling of IFR traffic.
    - Frequency presence and management, including communication priority.
- Vectoring, descent management, separation and spacing.
    - Techniques to maintain separation.
    - Understanding Separation Standards, where the standards are derived from and when they can be applied.
    - When and how to use Speed Control, understanding the use of ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ speeds and the impact of ‘compression’.
    - Understanding the definitions of ‘separation’ and ‘spacing’ alongside standard spacing requirements for various airfields.
- Establishing Aircraft on Approaches
    - Establishing aircraft on ILS approaches.
    - Establishing aircraft on RNP approaches.
    - Establishing aircraft on other instrument approaches.
    - Establishing aircraft on Visual Approaches.
- Co-ordination
    - Receiving or negotiating Inbound Releases and understanding the implications of various release types.
    - Understanding the ‘PRAWNS’ pneumonic to facilitate controller handovers.
    - Working split positions (INT/FIN splits).

### Block Two

Block two aims to develop on the knowledge obtained at Block One, whilst introducing more advanced concepts for streaming arriving aircraft, managing continuous descent approaches, managing holds and providing UK Flight Information Services. A student controller should, at the end of this block, be expected to demonstrate:

- The consolidation of skills and knowledge obtained at Block One.
- How to efficiently and safely sequence aircraft, considering:
    - How to establish an appropriate landing order for arrivals.
    - The facilitation of Continuous Descent Approaches when appropriate.
    - How to build streams of traffic, including merging streams of traffic from multiple terminal holds.
    - Planning for accommodating wake vortex separation.
    - Accommodating missed approaches.
    - Handling departures and their interactions with inbound aircraft.
- Hold management, including:
    - Entry and exit from the hold.
    - Descending aircraft within the hold.
    - Hold management, preparation and co-ordination.
- The provision of UK Flight Information Services, including:
    - Handling aircraft joining, crossing and leaving controlled airspace, facilitating appropriate service upgrades and downgrades.
    - The provision of Basic and Traffic services.
    - The provision of Deconfliction services with consideration to limitations of the service.
    - The provision of Radar Handovers to adjacent ATSUs.
- Final preparation for the S3 exam.

## Lessons Plans

In order to ensure that students beginning their S3 training are brokered to the syllabus in a consistent manner, the department requires that students are generally taken through a number of pre-determined lesson plans. Whilst these lesson plans provide a set structure for training, they may, at the discretion of the mentor, be condensed, replaced or re-ordered, depending on an individual students approach to training. 

### Lesson One

**Purpose:**
- To introduce the student to the Radar Display, demonstrating the capabilities of Euroscope and TopSky.
- To introduce the student to the concept of tracking and various Euroscope shortcuts to assist with this.
- To introduce the student to basic Radiotelephony concepts.
- To introduce the student to the effects of speed and altitude on aircraft performance.
- To demonstrate to the student basic vectoring and descent techniques.

This lesson is intended to take approximately 45-60 minutes.

| Objective | Training Notes | Success Criteria |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| 1 | The mentor should assist the student via means of a Discord screenshare. The mentor should identify or demonstrate:<br><br>- The four common radar profiles and how to promptly access them – and close them if required.<br>- How to access the SMR when covering a position on a top-down basis.<br>- The contents of the three tag types (untracked, tracked, detailed).<br>- The click-actions of each tag item.<br>- The use of leader lines and the separation tool.<br>- The use of the Display Menu to control airspace depiction.<br>- The use of TopSky shortcuts to toggle the display of VRPs and airspace bases. | The student can configure their radar display and demonstrates familiarity with the tag family and lists. The student can easily access elements of the radar display, either by selecting a new ASR or by using the display menu or TopSky shortcuts. |
| 2 | The mentor should describe the concept of *tracking* aircraft in Euroscope and how students should track, drop, transfer or force transfer aircraft. The mentor should have the student demonstrate:<br><br>- How to track an aircraft using the list, tag, or **F3** shortcut.<br>- How to drop the track using the list, tag, or **Shift + F4**.<br>- How to identify the controller that Euroscope recommends transferring to.<br>- How to transfer an aircraft to the recommended controller using **F4**, then clicking a tag, list item or using ASEL.<br>- How to forcibly transfer an aircraft using **F4**, typing a controller identifier, then clicking a tag, list item or using ASEL. | The student demonstrates the ability to track an aircraft, drop the track, transfer to the recommended controller, and transfer to a specified controller using a simulated aircraft. |
| 3 | The mentor should ensure that the student understands basic radiotelephony for:<br><br>- Turning an aircraft left or right.<br>- Turning onto a specified heading (“fly radar heading”).<br>- Descending an aircraft to a flight level.<br>- Descending an aircraft to an altitude.<br>- Clearing an aircraft for an ILS approach. | During the lesson, the student should be offered the opportunity to provide basic vectors and descents to a simulated aircraft. The student should issue CAP413-compliant instructions, with mentor support if required. The focus is on correct phraseology rather than proficiency.<br><br>There is no requirement to simulate initial check-ins, expected approach instructions, or delay information. |
| 4 | The mentor should explain basic aircraft performance principles. Using two simulated aircraft, one significantly higher than the other, the mentor should discuss performance implications during climb. A demonstration should then be made showing the effect of aircraft speed on turn radius. | The student should demonstrate:<br><br>- That higher aircraft typically have a higher groundspeed.<br>- That aircraft flying into wind will have a lower groundspeed.<br>- That faster aircraft have a larger turning radius than slower aircraft. |
| 5 | The student should be given time to practice vectoring aircraft freely, eventually resulting in at least one aircraft being vectored onto the ILS. | The student is given discretion to vector aircraft to understand timing and effect of actions. At least one aircraft should be vectored onto the ILS.<br><br>There is no requirement to ensure aircraft remain within controlled airspace, comply with restrictions, or establish on the ILS within normal tolerances. |

#### Required Future Learning
At the end of the session, the student should be directed to ensure that they revise the requirements for information to be verified with aircraft on first contact, alongside consolidating their knowledge of the required radiotelephony for block one items.

### Lesson Two

**Purpose:**
- To ensure the student is familiar with the required information to be exchanged on initial check-in.
- To ensure that the student is familiar with the IVV process.
- To ensure that the student is aware of their separation minima and how to apply them.
- To ensure that the student can perform basic streaming.

This lesson is intended to take approximately 60-90 minutes.

| Objective | Training Notes | Success Criteria |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| 1 | The mentor should discuss the requirements of the IVV process, ensuring theoretical understanding. The mentor should identify or demonstrate:<br><br>- The difference between identified and unidentified aircraft via correlated and uncorrelated tags.<br>- The process to manually correlate aircraft.<br>- The phraseology required to issue a new squawk.<br>- The phraseology to direct an aircraft to set a new squawk, having previously had one. | The student can:<br><br>- Explain the importance of identification.<br>- Explain the steps in the IVV process.<br>- Identify the correct Mode C validation tolerance.<br>- Spot an unidentified aircraft on the radar display.<br>- Issue an appropriate squawk.<br>- Correctly identify the aircraft.<br>- Explain how to manage departures that do not automatically complete code–callsign correlation. |
| 2 | The mentor should ensure the student understands separation minima and their origin. The student should also demonstrate understanding of how separation can be achieved and maintained. The student should be invited to:<br><br>- Vector two aircraft one behind the other and attempt to reduce spacing using speed.<br>- Observe that even moderate speed differences (e.g. 180 kt vs 250 kt) require significant time to create spacing.<br>- Create a situation with two aircraft nearly overhead and apply a 30° diverging heading, timing how long it takes to achieve 3 NM separation.<br><br>The purpose is to illustrate that:<br>- Speed can maintain separation but not build it.<br>- Headings are highly effective at building separation. | |
| 3 | Using these techniques, the student should stream three aircraft for an arrival. No focus is required on controlled airspace, RMAs or release points; the exercise is designed to introduce basic vectoring. <br><br>The student should also demonstrate *paralleling* — recognising that two aircraft at similar altitudes on the same heading will remain separated, allowing level swaps whilst maintaining separation. | The student can:<br><br>- Vector aircraft to achieve required separation and/or spacing.<br>- Stream aircraft by achieving similar ground tracks rather than paralleling.<br>- Apply suitable speed restrictions to maintain separation.<br>- Vector aircraft on parallel tracks to maintain separation.<br>- Correctly recall standard and reduced separation minima for known traffic and separation requirements for unknown traffic within controlled airspace. |

#### Required Future Learning
At the end of the session, the student should be directed to ensure that they revise the requirements for information to be verified with aircraft on first contact, alongside consolidating their knowledge of the required radiotelephony for block one items.

### Lesson Three

**Purpose:**
- To ensure the student is capable of reading ILS and RNP approach charts.
- To vector aircraft to establish on an ILS approach within the required profile.
- To recognise and understand the phraseology difference between “cleared ILS approach” and “once established on the localiser, descend on the glidepath”.

This lesson is intended to take approximately 60-90 minutes.

| Objective | Training Notes | Success Criteria |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| **1** | The mentor should begin with theoretical instruction on ILS and RNP approaches, using charts from an airfield other than the student’s training aerodrome. <br><br>The mentor should ensure understanding of the ILS components:<br>- Localiser<br>- Glidepath<br>- DME<br><br>The mentor should lead a discussion covering key chart elements:<br>- Approach type and runway<br>- Airfield and threshold elevations<br>- MSA<br>- ILS frequency<br>- Inbound course<br>- Platform altitude<br>- Descent point and DME<br>- Missed approach details<br>- IAF(s) and FAF<br><br>The student should then review a chart for their training aerodrome and identify the same elements. | The student can:<br><br>- Demonstrate understanding of the constituent parts of an approach chart.<br>- Interrogate an approach chart to identify critical information. |
| **2** | The mentor should discuss principles of establishing aircraft for ILS approaches, including:<br><br>- Aircraft must be below the glidepath to intercept.<br>- High-speed aircraft may overshoot the localiser.<br>- Aircraft must not establish on a heading more than 40° from the localiser.<br>- Aircraft should, where possible, experience straight and level flight before intercepting.<br><br>The mentor should explain phraseology differences for aircraft establishing above versus at/below platform altitude. <br><br>The student should then vector aircraft to establish on an instrument approach, respecting airspace confines, platform altitude and descent profile. | The student can:<br><br>- Vector aircraft appropriately in low-workload situations to establish on an approach.<br>- Consistently establish aircraft at the same intercept point.<br>- Manage aircraft speed appropriately throughout the arrival phase. |

#### Required Future Learning
At the end of the session, the student should be directed to ensure that they revise the local airspace of the position that they are controlling, with the intention of beginning live controlling. They should focus on the lateral and vertical constraints of their airspace and, if capacity allows, basic information regarding release points. 

---
    
## End Of Block Assessments

The S3 syllabus does not require an assessment at the end of block one. The natural progression of students is expected to slowly incorporate block two elements, although the mentor may be expected to either take control of the frequency, reject certain traffic scenarios or heavily coach the student through block two scenarios early in the live training.

At the end of block two, before a student is considered for a practical exam, an end of block two assessment should be conducted by a suitably experienced member of the training group, authorised by the Training Group Instructor, ATC Training Manager or ATC Training Director. The assessment should be conducted in exam conditions: an open book assessment whereby the student is expected to independently control appropriate volumes of traffic and demonstrate an acceptable level of competence of all competencies required within the syllabus. In normal circumstances, an examination should not be concluded until a block two assessment has been conducted and the prospective candidate demonstrated the required standard of control to pass an exam.

## Guidance to Mentors

It is widely regarded that the learning curve from S2 to S3 is the steepest that students will undergo throughout their ATC Training in VATSIM UK. Thus, mentors must ensure that students are theoretically prepared for their training and set realistic practical expectations for the first few mentoring sessions. Below is a list of do’s and don’ts through the S3 training programme

**DO:**
- Remind students that controlling with Mode C correlation is mandatory. The use of Easy VATSIM mode is not permitted.
- Discuss and check baseline theoretical knowledge between lessons – a solid theoretical foundation is critical to good practical development. 
- Set realistic goals for students. Approach radar training is difficult; there are many concepts to adopt and students are truly in control in three dimensions for the first time.
- Be open and honest; challenge students, remind them that they are responsible for their own development and stop sessions if the student has demonstrably not put the effort in. Inform students if they are not meeting the expected standard and inform the Training Group staff.
- Ask the student why they’re doing something – demonstrating and understanding of the tools, techniques, rules and restrictions is more critical at this level than for Aerodrome ratings.
- Use plenty of images in mentoring reports to supplement your description of learning points. Be thorough!

**DON’T:**
- Simply put the student straight into a live network session without having prepared them for it. Their confidence will be damaged when mistakes are made; this precious time to repair. 
- Bring in more advanced competencies from other blocks. Stick to teaching Block 1 competencies until the student demonstrates suitable proficiency. 
- Expect the student to know everything. The theoretical training resources are a great tool for preparation, but they cannot prepare students for handling the real thing. Guide students on where to find information and discuss why mistakes are made.
- Take control of the frequency unnecessarily – students have to make mistakes to learn and they cannot make mistakes if you take the frequency!
