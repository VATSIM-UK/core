**Version 1.0**
**Effective Date:** 01st November 2025

---

## Scope
This document details the training syllabus for VATSIM UK Student 3 controller training (S2->S3).

---

## Section 1 | Introduction
This syllabus details the competencies and content covered by the S3 training course in VATSIM UK. Students
will meet the learning objectives through independent study of material provided in eLearning courses and
traditional documentation, supported by mentors and instructors in one-to-one and group teaching
sessions. Students are encouraged to ask questions in the [#app_students channel](https://discord.com/channels/705488311346790471/1044164318285004830/1044587766383648881) on [Discord](https://www.vatsim.uk/discord)

## Section 3 | Block Training
S3 Training now incorporates block training as a way to standardise the Approach/Radar training process
and ensure all items are covered.

Students should complete all blocks before being forwarded for a practical exam unless an exception is
required (e.g., fast tracks). The block training system comprises of three blocks; students are only taught
competencies in their block until completing the content of each and then they complete the end of block
exam.

DIAGRAM GOES HERE

### 3.1 End of Block Exams

The End of Block Exam for Block 1 shall be carried out on the Sweatbox server to avoid having traffic that is
not in the syllabus for that block. For Block 2 and 3 the exam can be performed either on the network
(preferred) or the Sweatbox server. The decision of network or Sweatbox mock exam should take into
consideration traffic levels at a particular aerodrome at a particular time of day.

The instructor running end of block exams shall attempt to ensure that the majority if not all the criteria in
each block is assessed and should note criteria that has not been assessed and use their judgement and
experience to decide whether it is necessary to do training sessions on a topic that has not been assessed.

As normal if a student is deemed ready for the formal S3 Examination then they will be forwarded by the
relevant training staff and the real exam will be conducted as stipulated in the ATC Training Handbook.

### 3.1.1 CTS Permissions
- End of Block Exam 1 - APP_B1
- End of Block Exam 1 - APP_B2
- End of Block Exam 1 - APP_B3

### 3.1.2 First Session Guidance
It is widely regarded that the learning curve from S2 to S3 is the steepest that students will undergo
throughout their ATC Training tenure in VATSIM UK. Thus, mentors must ensure that students are
theoretically prepared for their training and set realistic practical expectations for the first few mentoring
sessions. Below is a list of do’s and don’ts for the first S3 mentoring session:

### **DO:**
- Ensure student’s Euroscope is correctly set up for the position they are training on. It is highly
recommended to have turned on:
    - RMA, where applicable
    - SMAA
    - Airspace bases
    - Holding fixes/release points
    - Any other symbology that aids learning (e.g. EDI/GLA Buffer)
- Discuss and check baseline theoretical knowledge from Block 1; A student that is knowledgeable and prepared will find the step-up considerably easier.
- Set realistic goals for students. Block 1 is a large chunk of the training so it will likely take a good number of sessions to master the competencies in the block.
- Pause the session and fix mistakes early. The quicker a student understand why they have made a mistake, the more likely they are to grasp trickier concepts quicker in the future.

### **DONT:**

- Simply put the student straight into a Sweatbox session without having prepared them for it. Their confidence will be damaged when mistakes are made; this precious time to repair.
- Bring in more advanced competencies from other blocks. Stick to teaching Block 1 competencies until the student has mastered them.
- Expect the student to know everything. The theoretical training resources are a great tool for preparation, but they cannot prepare students for handling the real thing. Guide students on where to find information and discuss **why** mistakes are made.

## Section 4 | Syllabus

### 4.1 Block 1
Block 1 focuses on the core of approach/radar controlling and a list of items covered along with useful links are found below:
- EuroScope Use
    - Mode A+C (Not Easy mode)
    - Tag Management
    - Contacting aircraft from unstaffed airspace and assigning a squawk using UKCP
    - Aircraft Select with keyboard (ASEL/Numpad +)
    - Knows how to enable and disable features not normally displayed (SMAA, airways, etc.)
- Airspace Classification
- R/T
    - Phraseology
    - Frequency Prescence and attitude
    - Frequency Management
- Identification, Validation, Verification (IVV)
- Vectoring and Descents and establishing on an ILS approach
    - Multiple streams of traffic and creative vectoring and use of airspace
    - Levels selected and lowest available and reasonable
- Speed Control
- Forward Planning
- Ensuring separation
- Local airfield knowledge (vMATS Part 2 GEN, APC & LOW Sections)
- Handovers (PRAWNS)
Where the concept of an item is based heavily in theory, links to sources will be made available.

### 4.1.1 Euroscope use

#### 4.1.1.1 Euroscope use
During S3 Training, for students, Mode A+C Correlation (C-Mode) is **mandatory**. Mentors should check this is enabled.
This can be checked in Other Set > General settings > Correlation mode > C-Mode

#### 4.1.1.2 Tag Management 
Approach Tags are NODE and NOVA 9000. Students should be able to use these tags and update them with every transmission.
By default, training aerodromes use:
- NODE for EGKK/EGSS
- NOVA 9000 for all other aerodromes

#### 4.1.1.3 Distance and Separation tools
EuroScope distance and separation tools can be accessed by pressing F1 then d/s or by typing. distance or .sep. They can also be accessed by left clicking the buttons below.

#### 4.1.1.4 Contacting and identifying aircraft from unstaffed airspace
Students should be able to send “contact me’s” to aircraft from unstaffed airspace and complete IVV, if a squawk is not assigned, they should know how to assign squawks using UKCP.
Aircraft not on the sector inbound list that are uncorrelated can be assumed two ways:
1. They can be manually correlated by clicking on the target and typing their callsign and then clicking assume.
2. They can be assumed while uncorrelated by typing a part of their callsign and pressing ASEL (Numpad +) and pressing F3 then ASEL again.

#### 4.1.1.5 Aircraft Select (ASEL)
EuroScope allows for tag manipulation with keyboard commands which also allows tags to
be manipulated while uncorrelated.

ASEL key (as default the numeric PLUS keyboard) - This is the aircraft selector key. To use
there should be some letters typed from the callsign. Pressing this button, the first callsign
that matches the letters typed before will be selected. You can press the ASEL key again to
select the next match. You can do it in a loop to see all matching callsigns.

To assume an uncorrelated target:
1. Ensure chat bar is empty and type in their callsign
2. Press ASEL (Numpad +)
3. Press F3
4. Press ASEL (Numpad +)

This then populates the sector exit list as the target is assumed, which allows for squawk generation.

If you do not have a numpad you may change the key to something else in: Other SET > General settings > Aircraft select key

#### 4.1.1.6 Other Useful Features
There are many things that can be enabled on the display settings.
- SMAA can be enabled in SIDS
- SMAA levels can be enabled for some airports in free text
- RMA can be changed in STARS
- Low and High Airways can be enabled for reference and to familiarise with different restrictions

Most of the time relevant information is enabled by default, pressing F1 and then number 1-9 will cycle between different radars.

Radar Screens:
1. Normal radar map, no fixes
2. Fixes, no labels
3. Bases of CAS
4. Fixes and VRPs with labels
