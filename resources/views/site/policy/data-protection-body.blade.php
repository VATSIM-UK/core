## Section 2 | Introduction

### 2.1 Purpose of policy

This policy has been put in place to achieve the following aims:

- to comply with the law, particularly the EU General Data Protection Regulation
- to ensure good data protection practice which when followed aims to protect members, staff, the
    organisation and other individuals using our services.

### 2.2 Types of data

VATSIM UK collects a range of personal data on members, both provided by the members directly and from
third parties.

#### 2.2.1 Data provided to us by a third party

While a member is using VATSIM UK services, or when they request to join the VATSIM UK division, data is
transmitted from VATSIM centrally to VATSIM UK for the purpose of ensuring the efficient functioning of our
services and to provide the requested user experience. This data includes:

- The member’s full name
- Their email address
- Their country of residence
- Their age band
- The simulated Air Traffic Control and/or Pilot Rating they have obtained with the VATSIM network
- Positions of responsibility they hold with the network, including level of access

#### 2.2.2 Data we collect from you

Whilst using our services, additional data is collected from and about you. This allows us to provide the
efficient functioning of our services and to provide the requested user experience. This data includes:

- IP address and connection info
- Records of webpages visited and services utilised
- Individual training records
- Your requests for support
- Disciplinary history
- Communications with other members
- Any data you submit to our systems through forms or actions taken while using any of our services.

Communication platforms, including our forum, have the functionality to receive any data, in the form of free-
text. Any personal data willingly submitted here by individuals (e.g. personal data such a telephone numbers or
addresses) will be retained and stored, even if removed from public view. This data is then only available to a
limited number of authorised individuals.

### 2.3 Policy Statement

VATSIM UK has an unequivocal commitment to:

- Comply with both the law and good practice
- Respect individuals’ rights including:
    o The right of access
    o The right of rectification
    o The right to object
    o The right to suspend protest
    o The right of erasure
- Be open and honest with individuals whose data is held
- Provide guidance for staff who handle personal data, so that they can act confidently and consistently
- Report any beliefs that a compromise of user data has occurred to the relevant data protection
    authorities voluntarily, even if not legally required to do so.

### 2.4 Key Risks

Key risks are detailed in Section 4 .5 of this document.

## Section 3 | Responsibilities

### 3.1 Division Staff Group

Overall responsibility for ensuring data protection and overall compliance with the relevant standards and
legislation rests collectively with the VATSIM UK Division Staff Group (DSG).

### 3.2 Data Protection Officer

The appointed Data Protection Officer is listed on the VATSIM UK staff page here: https://vatsim.uk/staff.

### 3.3 Specific Department Heads

Several members of the DSG have specific responsibilities to oversee others accessing personal data collected
by VATSIM:

- ATC Training Director – ATC Training Records
- Pilot Training Director – Pilot Training Records
- Web Services Director(s) – Remote access to, and control of stored data

Other members of the DSG may from time to time be tasked with specific responsibilities pertaining to the
control and storage of data.

### 3.4 Staff & Volunteers

All staff are required to read, understand and accept any policies and procedures that relate to the personal
data they may handle in the course of their work within VATSIM UK as detailed in this policy. VATSIM UK
expect the highest standard of probity of all staff at all levels. No access to data can take place unless there is a
valid network related reason for such access.

### 3.5 Enforcement

VATSIM UK has a zero-tolerance policy towards inappropriate access to data stored within our systems. Any
such access will result in the individual concerned being prohibited from having further access until such a time
that the risk to personal data has been suitably mitigated.

## Section 4 | Security

### 4.1 Scope

This section applies to all VATSIM UK's servers belonging to or donated to the VATSIM UK division, including,
but not limited to Data Servers, Statistic Servers, or Web Servers.

### 4.2 Setting security levels

VATSIM UK operates on a segmented security approach, where only the access required (with approval
members holding the status of “Privileged Access”) to complete a required job is granted.

VATSIM UK employs access monitoring systems to ensure that access is not being abused and can be traced
back to a specific individual.

### 4.3 Security measures

VATSIM UK employs standard methods of encryption to safeguard data, such as TLS encryption for accessing
data via a web browser. VATSIM UK also implements additional change-audit scripts and monitors to provide
visibility into server activity.

IP Address and asymmetric based security settings are used to only allow server access to authorised users or
servers.

Passwords (excluding your network password which is never passed to VATSIM UK) are stored as salted
hashes, preventing them from being viewed in plain text. This includes your secondary password for Core, if
set.

### 4.4 Business continuity

In order to ensure business continuity, VATSIM UK retains data backups of relevant systems to ensure a speedy
recovery of impacted systems while maintaining data integrity and security.

These backups are encrypted, and access is granted only to authorised individuals.

### 4.5 Specific risks

The main specific risks to the security of data are:

- Phishing attacks to gain server level access,
- Access by means of trojan or keylogging programs on members systems, and
- Access by unauthorised staff members who have been granted access

Mitigation of the first two risks is firstly by screening all individuals before granting access and secondary,
encouraging members who have a higher level of access to ensure they adhere to good security practices on
their personal systems. The last risk is mitigated by access logging and reverting changes made by those who
misuse access.

## Section 5 | Data recording and storage

### 5.1 Accuracy

The majority of membership data is passed to VATSIM UK by VATSIM. As such, we assume that this data is
accurate. Where it is not, we facilitate the rectification of this, as set out in section 8 of this policy.

### 5.2 Updating

A VATSIM member may request an update of his/her retained information by making a request in writing to
privacy@vatsim.uk.

### 5.3 Storage

Data is stored in standard file systems and databases. Access to these systems is controlled by secure direct
access to the controlling machine or application, or via a secure web interface. Access is further controlled and
protected against unauthorized access using standard measures, such as role-based access control.

### 5.4 Retention periods

VATSIM UK is bound by the retention periods of VATSIM, set out in their Data Protection and Handling Policy.
Requests for erasure can be processed by VATSIM UK but may need escalating to VATSIM in order to fulfil the
entirety of the request.

### 5.5 Archiving

VATSIM UK does not archive any data to other servers at this point in time for long term storage. Data is either
maintained within the production environment and backed up as per section 4 .4, or deleted entirely.

## Section 6 | Transparency

### 6.1 Commitment

VATSIM UK is committed to ensuring all members are aware of what data is collected and why we do so.

As outlined in the statement of legitimate interests within the VATSIM UK Privacy Policy, data is collected for
the purpose of ensuring the provision of, and smooth operation of the VATSIM UK division so that members
can jointly enjoy the simulated aviation environment it provides.

Data may be transferred to other organisations affiliated with, or associated with, the division to provide
services to enhance and extend the simulated aviation environment. Who we transfer data to is covered
within the VATSIM UK Privacy Policy. Where it is not covered, we will seek your permission to pass on
personally identifiable data before doing so.

### 6.2 Procedures

Details on how to exercise rights in relation to the data held is detailed in the relevant sections of this policy.

### 6.3 Responsibility

All staff within VATSIM UK are responsible for the data they access at all times. The various departments most
closely associated with members' data are the Web Services Department and Division Staff Group.

Where staff are required to use data for statistical and management purposes, anonymous aggregated or
pseudonymised data will be used where possible.

## Section 7 | Right of Access

### 7. 1 Responsibility

Requests for personal data under the Right of Access are the responsibility of the appointed Data Protection
Officer and their team. Such requests are required to be complied with within one month of the request being
received. If circumstances prevent this from occurring, an extension of a further two months may be instituted
by VATSIM UK, providing that the member making the request is informed of this fact before the expiration of
the original one month deadline.

### 7.2 Procedure for making request

Right of access requests must be sent via email to sar@vatsim.uk.

If staff at a lower level receive anything that might reasonably be construed to be a request for access they
have a responsibility to pass this to the appointed Data Protection Officer, as defined in section 3.2.

### 7.3 Provision for verifying identity

Where the person managing the access procedure does not know the individual personally, the individual's
identity will be verified before handing over any information.

### 7.4 Charging

VATSIM UK will not charge any fee for processing or providing data for requests under the Right of Access.

### 7.5 Procedure for granting access

The appointed Data Protection Officer is responsible for handling requests under the Right of Access
provisions.

Requests will be made via sar@vatsim.uk.

Only personal data will be shared with the member. Other individuals’ personal data will be redacted.

## Section 8 | Right of Rectification

### 8.1 Responsibility

Accurate data is in the best interests of both the network and the membership. The appointed Data Protection
Officer is responsible for the management of such requests.

### 8.2 Procedure for making request

Right of rectification requests should be made to privacy@vatsim.uk.

If staff at a lower level receive anything that might reasonably be construed to be a request for rectification
they have a responsibility to direct the member to the above email address.

### 8.3 Charging

VATSIM UK will not charge any fee for requests under the Right of Rectification.

## Section 9 | Lawful Basis

### 9.1 Underlying principles

VATSIM UK asserts that it has a legitimate interest in collecting and storing the personal data outlined above.
The reasons for this claim are:

VATSIM UK is a voluntary community promoting flight simulations and virtual air traffic control, and all
members seeking to join have an obvious interest in such activities.

The data collected is the minimum required to allow for the smooth and optimal running of the division, solely
for the enjoyment of its members.

That the data is necessary to allow for VATSIM UK staff to properly manage the division, both in day to day
operations, and in circumstances where a member(s) may act in a manner contrary to the rules and
regulations that govern the division.

### 9.2 Members under 16 years

VATSIM UK relies on VATSIM to ensure that parental consent is collected from users unable to provide their
own consent (because they fall below the minimum age to do so, as defined under the GDPR or other local
regulations).

VATSIM UK acknowledges its responsibility to inform VATSIM of any members that may be below this age and
that are actively participating on the network without suitable consent.

### 9. 3 Opting out

Notwithstanding VATSIM UK’s claim of legitimate interest, members may object to this claim and/or request
that VATSIM UK cease processing of a member’s personal data. These two rights are known as the Right to
Object, and the Right to Restrict Processing.

Members must be aware that if they choose to exercise either of these rights VATSIM UK is obliged to lock
their accounts in order to comply with their wishes and their request may be referred to VATSIM to take the
appropriate action for their network account too.

### 9.4 Timing of opting out

While a notification of an objection to VATSIM UK’s claim of legitimate interest, or a request to suspend
processing may be made at any time, such claims may not be made retrospectively.

## Section 10 | Right of Erasure

### 10.1 Responsibility

Requests for deletion of personal data under the Right of Erasure are the responsibility of the appointed Data
Protection Officer and their team. Such requests are required to be complied with within one calendar month
of the request being received.

If circumstances prevent this from occurring, an extension of a further two months may be instituted by
VATSIM UK, providing that the member making the request is informed of this fact before the expiration of the
original one-month deadline.

### 10.2 Procedure for making request

The appointed Data Protection Officer is responsible for handling requests under the Right of Erasure
provisions.

Requests will be made via privacy@vatsim.uk.

If staff at a lower level receive anything that might reasonably be construed to be a request for erasure they
have a responsibility to pass this to the appointed Data Protection Officer without delay.

### 10.3 Provision for verifying identity

Where the person managing the erasure procedure does not know the individual personally, the individual's
identity will be verified before handing over any information.

### 10.4 Charging

VATSIM UK will not charge any fee for deleting data under the Right of Erasure.

### 10.5 Procedure for granting erasure

VATSIM UK shall evaluate all requests for erasure. VATSIM UK reserves the right to retain any data that it
believes is in its legitimate interest to do so, or that is required to establish, exercise, or defend any legal
claims.

## Section 11 | Staff training & Acceptance of Responsibilities

### 11.1 Induction
