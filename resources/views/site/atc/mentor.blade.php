                    All members holding a Permanent Controller Rating of S1 or higher are invited to become an ATC
                    mentor in VATSIM UK. The ATC Training Department depends almost entirely on willing volunteers
                    giving up their time to pass on knowledge to upcoming controllers. As a mentor you will be
                    conducting practical and theoretical sessions with students as they work towards their next rating,
                    providing feedback that is recorded and available to the student throughout their journey. Mentoring
                    in the UK is completely voluntary and the division is grateful for any time that a member can spend
                    mentoring, no matter how small. Mentoring is, however, a privilege and not a right.

                    <h2>Prerequisites For Mentoring</h2>
                    There are two prerequisites for ATC mentors in the UK:

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            You must hold the Permanent Controller Rating equivalent to the position on which you are
                            mentoring and, if applicable, any additional validations (for example, Heathrow)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You must have spent sufficient time consolidating your knowledge at a given level, before
                            being able to mentor there
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    Requirement number two may be waived at the discretion of the ATC Training Department. For example,
                    a student who performs very strongly in an S3 exam may be invited to mentor on radar sooner, as
                    consolodation at this point becomes a box ticking exercise. This requirement is also particularly
                    pertinent to S1 rated members, as the S1 rating officially encompases no formal competencies. Hence,
                    mentors with an S1 rating are those that have spent a considerable time controlling and are often
                    working towards their S2 rating.

                    <h2>Mentor Training</h2>
                    Your first mentoring session(s) at a particular level will be conducted in collaboration with a
                    VATSIM UK Instructor. This is not a formal exam, it is simply a chance for an instructor to observe
                    the mentor conducting a session, in order to help the mentor develop effective and efficient
                    teaching style and methods. This provides mentors an opportunity to be guided as they begin
                    teaching. Mentors returning after a significant period away from the network may be asked, at the
                    discretion of the ATC Training Department, to have a supervised session on their return, to ensure
                    that they are comfortable with any changes that have happened in the meantime.

                    <h2>Mentoring Positions</h2>
                    At present, members may typically mentor in one of the primary Training Groups (TG1 and TG2) and
                    additionally one of the remaining Training Groups (TGLL, TGNC, TGE). This policy is currently under
                    review.

                    <h2>Expectations</h2>
                    By becoming a mentor, you agree to the following terms, which are in place to ensure efficient
                    training and fair treatment to students.

                    <h2>Preferential Mentoring</h2>
                    There is to be no preferential mentoring in VATSIM UK. Mentoring sessions should be accepted in the
                    order in which they appear in the session requests list, for the position that you wish to mentor
                    on, during the time period that you can mentor. Preferential mentoring, or specifically skipping
                    particular students is not acceptable under any circumstances. If you feel that there is some
                    impediment to you mentoring a particular student, you must raise this with Training Group staff
                    immediately.

                    <h2>Mentoring Reports</h2>
                    All mentoring sessions in VATSIM UK are completed along with a session report in the Central
                    Training System. These reports, whilst they appear long, are not supposed to be exhaustive - you do
                    not have to fill in every single box if there is nothing to say. At an APP and CTR level, it is
                    common for half of the report to be empty as certain criteria wouldn't have been covered in that
                    particular session. It is important that you balance out positive and negative comments wherever
                    possible - there is nothing worse as a student than being bombarded by a wall of criticism. All
                    mentoring reports must be completed within 72 hours of the session. This is essential so that
                    students may see feedback on their performance and also so that future mentors may see your comments
                    and structure their session accordingly. Training Group Staff will actively chase up any overdue
                    mentoring reports, if for whatever reason you need extra time to fill in a report, please raise a
                    ticket with ATC Training in the helpdesk.<br />
                    <br />
                    All criteria on mentoring reports are graded on the following scale:

                    <ul>
                        <li> Not Covered - Has never been previously demonstrated.</li>
                        <li> Work Required - Has been demonstrated but requires significant mentor input.</li>
                        <li> Satisfactory - Has been demonstrated and requires a fair amount of mentor input.</li>
                        <li> Good - Has been demonstrated and requires minimal mentor input.</li>
                        <li> Test Standard - Has been demonstrated and requires no mentor input.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Practical Considerations</h2>
                    There are a few practical considerations with regards to mentoring.

                    <h2>Callsigns</h2>
                    Information regarding mentoring callsigns may be found in VATSIM UK's Division Policy, which is
                    available on the website downloads section.

                    <h2>Advertising Sessions and Traffic Requests</h2>
                    Advertisements for mentoring sessions and specific requests may be made in this <a href="https://community.vatsim.uk/topic/22218-traffic-requests-here/">forum thread</a>.

                    <h2>Use Of Sweatbox</h2>
                    VATSIM provides the Sweatbox server - a simulation environment that allows mentors to generate
                    specific traffic situations for a student. These may be geared towards practicing specific skills or
                    handling higher-than-average workload. It is important that Sweatbox is not over-used. We are very
                    fortunate in the UK to have a large number of movements into our airfields and we should therefore
                    aim to utilise them. Moreover, students also need to practice skills with pilots that aren't perfect
                    in every way. Therefore, Sweatbox should be used sparingly, with the majority of sessions conducted
                    on the live network.

                    <h2>Session Structure</h2>
                    There is no clear answer regarding how to structure a session, it depends on many factors. However,
                    a popular method is to begin with a practical session on the network. Once this is complete, the
                    mentor may wish to ask some theory questions (ideally, relevant to what has happened in the session)
                    or go through some theory material and finally end with a short debrief, covering the main points of
                    the session. In the event of a quiet session, it may be pertinent to do some of the theoretical
                    element during the gaps in traffic, to keep the student engaged.

                    <h2>When To Interrupt</h2>
                    An important consideration when mentoring is when to interupt the student mid-flow to correct them
                    or provide alternative advice - this can be detrimental as it can break the student's flow and have
                    a negative effect further down the line. Unless there is an imminent safety concern, it can be
                    beneficial to allow the situation to play out and see how/if the student resolves it themself. Also,
                    when you do need to interrupt it may be beneficial to interrupt with a question, rather than a
                    directive, which allows the student to find the answer themselves. For example, if the student has
                    given an unsafe instruction, you may wish to challenge them with something like "Are you sure that
                    instruction is safe?" to see if they reconsider and find the problem. Equally, at times it may be
                    good (where appropriate) to challenge a student when everything is actually ok, to ensure that they
                    are confident in what they are doing and can explain why everything is as it should be.

                    <h2>Solo Validations</h2>
                    When a student is nearing an exam, they may be eligible for a solo validation on their exam
                    position, in order to practice without mentor supervision. The minimum requirement for being awarded
                    a solo validation is that the student must have achieved "Satisfactory" in all criteria on the
                    mentoring report. If you feel that the student is ready for a solo validation, please open a ticket
                    with ATC Training in the <a href="https://helpdesk.vatsim.uk/">helpdesk</a>. Ultimately, whilst these requests are usually honoured, there may
                    be one or two instances where the request for a solo validation is declined, which is entirely at
                    the discretion of the Training Group staff.

                    <h2>Staff Drop Ins</h2>
                    From time to time, an instructor may sit in on a mentoring session or review mentoring reports and
                    give feedback to the mentor. This is entirely normal and is part of the division monitoring
                    progression and standards of ATC training. It is appreciated if all mentors could accomodate this as
                    far as practical.

                    <h2>Get Started</h2>
                    If you are interested in mentoring in VATSIM UK, please open a ticket in the <a href="https://helpdesk.vatsim.uk/">helpdesk</a>, stating which
                    Training Groups you would be interested in mentoring in.
