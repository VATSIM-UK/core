# Welcome!
Welcome to the exciting world of air traffic control (ATC) in VATSIM UK. If you already have some experience of VATSIM as a pilot, this will certainly provide you with a head start, but it is by no means necessary.
You do not even need to own a copy of Flight Simulator; the software for VATSIM ATC is standalone and entirely free of charge!

Becoming a controller requires a certain amount of training before being allowed to control 'live' traffic. While undertaking training a certain amount of commitment and self study is required - so be prepared for this!
There is a system of graduated controller ratings that determine the ATC positions you can control, so being a VATSIM controller is a constant learning process.
We want this to be both enjoyable and educational!

We appreciate that personal circumstances vary, but we still require a certain amount of availability so our mentors can accept your session requests.
If you have any concerns about this - please reach out to us via the [helpdesk](https://helpdesk.vatsim.uk/).

If you’re not already a member of VATSIM’s UK division, the first step is to follow the instructions on the [Join Us](https://www.vatsim.uk/join) page – you’ll need to ensure that your division is set to ‘United Kingdom’.
If you need to make a change, this may take up to 24 hours to process.
**You will lose your place on the waiting list if you later transfer to another division, and will be unable to undertake training in VATSIM UK.**

## Required Software

### EuroScope and the UK Controller Pack
VATSIM as a whole endorses several controller clients for use on the network, but the UK division only provides training using the EuroScope client.
Installation instructions for this are available on the [EuroScope website](https://euroscope.hu/).

Our Operations Department produces and maintains a controller pack, which provides EuroScope with data on the UK’s airspace structure to display on your screen.
You can download the [UK Controller Pack](https://docs.vatsim.uk/General/Software%20Downloads/Controller%20Pack%20%26%20Sector%20File/) from the downloads section of our website: be sure to precisely follow the instructions in the README.pdf file provided.

### Audio for VATSIM
[Audio for VATSIM](https://audio.vatsim.net/docs/2.0/atc/euroscope) is the programme we utilise to transmit and receive on ATC frequencies.
This software will allow you to connect and observe current controllers on frequency.

### TeamSpeak
[TeamSpeak](https://www.vatsim.uk/community/teamspeak) is a voice communication program we use for training sessions, coordination between controllers, and simply having a chat!
You’ll need to install and set-up TeamSpeak to take part in our training programmes.

## Discord
[Discord](https://www.vatsim.uk/discord) allows you to connect with the VATSIM UK Community and interact with fellow controllers and pilots.
