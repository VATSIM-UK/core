                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    London Heathrow (EGLL) is the only airfield in VATSIM UK that has been designated as a major
                    aerodrome under the regulations set out in VATSIM's Global Ratings Policy. Members rated S2 or
                    higher may undertake a number of special endorsements to be allowed to control Heathrow positions up
                    to and including their permanent controller rating. VATSIM UK does not offer training at Heathrow
                    towards a new permanent controller rating. These endorsements are also required for any controller
                    that wishes to open or be trained on the London South sector group or encompassing bandboxes.

                    <h3>Endorsements Offered</h3>
                    Heathrow offers a total of three endorsements:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ground and Delivery;</li>
                        <li>Tower;</li>
                        <li>Approach Radar.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Endorsement Process</h3>
                    The endorsement process for all Heathrow endorsements is the same, as follows:

                    <ol>
                        <li>Enroll on the online Moodle course relevant to the validation to be achieved;</li>
                        <li>Complete the Moodle course and pass the final exam;</li>
                        <li>Undertake practical sessions with a Heathrow mentor.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Get Started</h3>
                    If you are interested in obtaining a Heathrow endorsement, please submit a ticket to ATC Training in
                    the <a href="https://helpdesk.vatsim.uk/">helpdesk</a>.

                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    After Heathrow, London Gatwick (EGKK) is by far the busiest airfield in VATSIM UK, boasting close to
                    50,000 movements every year. Controlling at London Gatwick is restricted by the ATC Training
                    Department to S2 rated members or S1's that hold a special endorsement. This restriction for S1's is
                    in place to allow members to gain experience in quieter environments and practice their new-found
                    skills before tackling the workload at Gatwick.

                    <h3>Endorsements Offered</h3>
                    Gatwick offers one endorsement:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ground and Delivery for S1 Rated Controllers.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    London Bandbox (LON_CTR) is a designated special center under the terms of the <a
                            href="https://www.vatsim.net/grp/">VATSIM Global Ratings
                        Policy</a>, covering all four primary London Control sectors. Controllers rated C1 or higher may
                    apply
                    for an endorsement to open this position.

                    <h3>Requirements</h3>
                    In order to be granted a London Bandbox endorsement, the controller must meet the following
                    requirements:
                    <ul>
                        <li>20 hours post-C1 on two of the four sectors within the EGTT FIR (40 total);</li>
                        <li>10 hours post-C1 on the remaining two sectors within the EGTT FIR (20 total);</li>
                        <li>An additional 20 hours post-C1 on any VATSIM CTR sector (including those above).</li>
                    </ul>
                    Time spent controlling split or bandbox positions (for example LTC_CTR or LON_SC_CTR) may only be
                    counted towards requirement 3 above.

                    <h3>Guidance</h3>
                    The amount of traffic in the London FIR varies significantly throughout the day and can increase
                    dramatically at very short notice. Furthermore, the amount of top-down controlling can vary
                    depending on which adjacent controllers are online. Controllers are therefore advised to use caution
                    when exercising the privileges of their validation. It is often wise to use the validation either
                    during the quieter hours of the evening, when there are a number of Approach positions online
                    covering the major aerodromes, or to cover off remaining sectors when other London sectors are open.
                    Equally, if traffic levels increase significantly, controllers should consider downsizing to a
                    smaller sector.

                    <h3>Get Started</h3>
                    If you wish to apply for a London Bandbox endorsement, please <a href="https://helpdesk.vatsim.uk">open
                        a ticket</a> with ATC Training in the helpdesk. In the ticket, you should state your VATSIM CID,
                    the qualifying CTR positions you have controlled and time spent on each.

                    <h3>Background</h3>

                    through a number of self study courses. With this endorsement, controllers are permitted to open
                    military positions both in the UK and it's overseas territories, in accordance with the letters of
                    agreement, division policy and military manual.

                    <h3>Endorsements Offered</h3>
                    At present, four types of military endorsement are offered by VATSIM UK.

                    </ul>

                    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
                    In order to be able to be eligible for military endorsement, a controller must meet the following requirements.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Must be a home member or a visitor that has completed a visiting application;</li>
                        <li>Must be rated S2 or higher;</li>
                        <li>Must hold the equivalent permanent controller rating to the endorsement that they wish to undertake;</li>
                        <li>Members wishing to undertake the PAR endorsement must hold the Approach endorsement.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Endorsement Process</h3>
                    The endorsement process for all military endorsements offered by VATSIM UK is as follows.

                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    VATSIM UK has a large number of pilots that enjoy a little jaunt across the country in a light
                    aircraft, enjoying the sights and freedoms of VFR. We also have a number of small aerodromes that
                    are hotspots for this activity, which is now tied in with the Pilot Training Department's Flight
                    Training Exercises (FTE's). These smaller aerodromes do not provide a full Air Traffic Service, but
                    instead either an Aerodrome Flight Information Service (AFIS) or Air/Ground Communications Service
                    (AGCS).

                    <h3>Requirements</h3>
                    As such, we offer S1's the opportunity to become endorsed on a select number of these positions through an online self-learning (Moodle) course. This course may be enrolled on at any time by any member. The endorsement process is as follows:
                    <ol>
                        <li>In order to be eligible to take the Moodle exam, the member must have acquired a total of 50 hours controlling on ground and delivery positions in the UK;</li>
                        <li>Once the hour requirement is met, the member submits a ticket to the helpdesk asking to be enrolled in the Moodle exam;</li>
                        <li>The member must pass the exam at the end of the Moodle course and informs the training department via the helpdesk that they have passed.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Approved Aerodromes</h3>
