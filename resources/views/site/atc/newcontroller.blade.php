                        Depending on demand, your training will take place at one of three training aerodromes: Edinburgh, Manchester or Stansted.&nbsp;

                        It varies from student to student, and with the amount of time you are able to dedicate to your training. Most students take two-three months after attending an introductory group session, any issues meaning this is not possible for you can be discussed with us and we will aim to accommodate.
