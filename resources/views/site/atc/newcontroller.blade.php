                            This system is used for arranging individual and group training sessions as well as for
                            taking theory tests
                            and making ATC bookings.

                            &#39;Request&#39; under the &#39;Transfer Home Group&#39; section. This is not processed
                            automatically so
                            approval could take up to 48 hours. Once your request has been processed you will receive an
                            automatic email
                            from the CT System.

                            We now operate an automatic queuing system for OBS controllers before their Observing group
                            session. This
                            means those who have been waiting the longest for the session will have priority in booking
                            it. You should
                            receive a notification email when a session is available for you, but do occasionally check
                            the system also.

                            When a group session is available you will be able to see it on the &#39;Management&#39;
                            page under the
                            &#39;Sessions&#39; subheading in the &#39;Students&#39; menu. There are a limited number of
                            places available
                            at each session. Places normally become available for booking 3 to 5 days prior to the
                            session. There are a
                            limited number of places at each session, available on a first-come first-served basis.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If there are no group sessions visible in the list, but you can see the blue information
                            box, then there are
                            no sessions currently scheduled, but we will be posting more soon. We post session dates as
                            soon as they
                            have been planned here, so please don&#39;t contact us to ask when the next session will be
                            - as soon as we
                            know, it will be on the system.

                        <li>
                            If a session is full, you may want to check back at regular intervals, because a place may
                            become available
                            again if another student cancels.
                        </li>

                    <p>
                        The session will be held on <a href="{{ route('site.community.teamspeak') }}" rel="">TeamSpeak</a>
                        and
                        will be an opportunity for you to meet us and for us to introduce the basics of VATSIM ATC and
                        of using the
                        controller client software.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You will need to have <a href="https://community.vatsim.uk/downloads/" rel="">EuroScope, with
                            the UK Controller
                            Pack</a>, and <a href="{{ route('site.community.teamspeak') }}" rel="">TeamSpeak</a>
                        installed and
                        set up ready for the session. We recommend that you do this in good time in advance of the
                        session so there is
                        time to resolve any difficulties that you might have.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Upon completing this session, the theory exam on the generic theory Moodle course will be
                        unlocked for you.

                        Make sure that you read the manual for the controller client you wish to use and become familiar

                        questions about using your client, feel free to ask in our forums.

                        The OBS-S1 Part 2 session is a short practical assessment carried out by your mentor. You are
                        not expected to be
                        perfect in every aspect, and assistance and guidance will be provided throughout. You are

                        demonstrate that you have some understanding, and capability to improve with practice, on the

                    <p>
                        Your mentor will go through each point helping you to understand what is required and testing
                        your knowledge. If
                        your mentor feels you are capable in these basic competencies, you will have successfully passed
                        your OBS-S1
                        Part 2 session and you are now ready to control solo on the network for the first time as an S1.
                        Your upgrade to
                        the Student 1 (S1) rating is a manual process, so please allow up to 48 hours for it to take
                        place. You will
                        receive an email when the database has been updated, and will be able to log on as soon as you
                        receive this.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As a Student 1 (S1) you may control any DEL or GND positions in VATSIM UK, with the exception of
                        London Heathrow
                        (EGLL) and Military aerodromes which require separate <a

                        controller rating of Student 2 (S2) or higher.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You will then be removed from the New Controller Training Group as you will only remain inside a
                        Training Group
                        when you are actively training in it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When moving onto new positions, make sure you read up on the appropriate documentation and fetch
                        the resources
                        you need in order to give your pilots the best service possible. Now it&#39;s time to
                        consolidate your
                        knowledge, get some experience and enjoy your new rating!

                        When you are in a position where you feel comfortable to continue your training send us a ticket

                        bear in mind that due to the high demand for training these are currently quite substantial and
                        there is, as of
                        January 2017, an expected minimum wait of 6 months. Central Training - VATSIM UK&rsquo;s new
                        training programme
                        is slowly being phased in during 2017 so please be aware the current processes may change

                    <p>
                        Depending on demand, your training will take place at either Manchester or Edinburgh.&nbsp;
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It varies from student to student. Once you have been given permissions to request 1-1 mentoring
                        with one of our mentors, it can take anything between 1 to 5 sessions.&nbsp;

                        You will be sent an invite to a group session via email when you are eligible for one. You can
                        see group sessions (OBS_PT1) that are available&nbsp;to you via the <a
                                href="https://cts.vatsim.uk/students/seminar.php" rel="external nofollow">&#39;Seminar&#39;

                    <p>
                        No, you will not have to do the exam again after you start your training. Students will need to
                        pass the theory exam before given permissions to request 1-1 sessions. It does not matter at
                        what point in your training you have passed the <a href="https://cts.vatsim.uk/theory/setup.php"
