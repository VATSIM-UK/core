                        VATSIM operates an ATC ratings system, where your rating determines what you can control on the

                        requirements for attaining each rating is explained in this section. Each rating is listed and

                    <p>
                        In order to progress through the controller ratings, you will need to take a series of theory
                        exams along the
                        way as part of your training. The following is standard across all theory exams:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The exam will consist of 20 multiple choice questions selected at random from the database
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The pass mark for all theory exams is 80%
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You will be advised of the result of your exam immediately upon completion, together with a
                            list of
                            questions which you didn&#39;t answer correctly
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You have 20 minutes to complete the exam. If your web browser supports Javascript a
                            countdown timer will
                            show your time remaining
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Ensure you answer every question; unanswered questions will score as incorrect answers but
                            will not deduct
                            points from your score

                        <li>
                            If you fail the exam there is a 7 day waiting period before you may retake the exam, use
                            this time to read
                            up on the topics you were weaker on

                        <li>
                            It is only possible to attempt the theory exam for one level above your current rating i.e.
                            a Student 2 can
                            only attempt the Senior Student (S3) exam

                                You must register a pass in the theory exam for the appropriate level before you can be
                                submitted for
                                the practical exam

                        Your training now moves onto Tower, and the skills required as a tower controller will be
                        steadily introduced to
                        you. Your training then continues until you are at the required standard in all aspects

                        any issues. At the end of the exam, you will be told whether you have passed or not. If you have
                        passed,
                        congratulations! You will now be upgraded to Student (S2). After the exam, you will receive

                        re-attempting the exam. There is no minimum waiting period between practical exams.

                    <p>
                        Area positions are the most complex types of ATC position to control, and require a large time
                        commitment in
                        order to learn all the materials and skills needed for the job. Area exams can be carried out on
                        any core London
                        sector (North, South, Central or West) or Scottish Control (SCO_CTR).

                    <p>
                        Before you can take your area practical exam, you need to take your last theory exam.
                        This exam will
                        cover the following:

                        Before you start your online area training with a mentor, it is expected you spend some time
                        learning the
                        underlying Approach positions for the sector you wish to learn. Students are expected to be
                        reasonably
                        comfortable with the top-down services they may need to provide on their area sector.

                        need to submit a

                        not submit your
                        application until you have fully achieved all of the requirements by an obvious margin, as
                        processing
                        applications which barely meet the requirements takes far longer to verify.
