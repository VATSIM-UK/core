## Background
London Heathrow (EGLL) is the only airfield in VATSIM UK that has been designated as a major
aerodrome under the regulations set out in VATSIM's Global Ratings Policy. Members rated S2 or higher
may undertake a number of special endorsements to be allowed to control Heathrow positions up to and
including their permanent controller rating. VATSIM UK does not offer training at Heathrow towards a
new permanent controller rating. These endorsements are also required for any controller that wishes to
open or be trained on the London South sector group or encompassing bandboxes.

## Endorsements Offered
Heathrow offers a total of three endorsements:
- Ground and delivery
- Tower
- Approach (Director)
