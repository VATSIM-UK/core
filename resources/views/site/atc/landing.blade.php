                        The ATC Training Department is responsible for developing and implementing the training scheme
                        for controllers, as well as providing mentoring and examinations towards rating progression. We
                        also offer a number of optional endorsements and conduct all transferring controller rating
                        ratifications.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The ATC Training department is structured into &quot;Training Groups&quot;, each of which deal
                        with specific types of training at various facilities. The administrative aspect of Training 
                        Groups are handled by the team of ATC Training and Member Services staff; please always use the 
                        <a href="https://helpdesk.vatsim.uk/">Helpdesk</a> for queries related to ATC Training. Each 
                        Training Group has a number of Training Group Instructors (TGI), who are responsible for 
                        overseeing training in their respective groups - ensuring suitable progression and maintaining 
                        standards. Every Training Group also has a number of mentors. The mentors provide practical 
                        mentoring sessions to students and help them progress towards their next rating.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The current training groups are:

                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        There are also a number of Division Instructors (I3 rated), who are experienced and long-standing 
                        members take a wider view of training, from the perspective of the entire division.
                        They work on projects assigned to them by, and provide counsel to, the Training Director.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The department maintains a pool of examiners. These members are experienced as controllers
                        and mentors and are responsible for conducting Practical Exams and Transferring Controller
                        Validations. All exams in VATSIM UK are assigned to a particular examiner, to ensure that all
                        examiners conduct a fair amount of exams and that there are no conflicts of interest.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Overall, the department is managed by the ATC Training Administrative Manager, who looks after
                        the day-to-day running of all the Training Groups, and the ATC Training Director who is
                        responsible for the department as a whole.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There are plenty of opportunities to get involved in ATC Training. We are always looking for
                        mentors to pass their knowledge on to the next generation of controllers and the department is
                        grateful for any time, no matter how small, that a member is willing to give up to train new
                        controllers. We are also in the process of creating online learning courses, to allow members to
                        self-teach and reduce our training times. Members who have a passion for writing accessible
                        learning content are more than welcome to contribute to our online learning courses.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Or, even if you just have an idea that you want heard, the department is always open to new
                        ideas and we acknowledge that sometimes the best ideas come from outside the department. So, if
                        you&#39;ve got a good idea for the future of ATC Training, please get in touch so we can discuss
                        it.
