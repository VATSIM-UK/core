                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>The Flying Programme is an extension of the P0 Initial Pilot rating aimed at assisting pilots
                        starting on the network, pilots who are not confident on the network, or any pilots who feel they
                        may benefit from 1-on-1 sessions to improve their VATSIM and flying skills. The programme offers
                        support for both VFR and IFR pilots, helping those flying visually in aircraft such as the C152,
                        C172, and PA28, or operating IFR aircraft like the Boeing 737NG series or Airbus A320 family, get
                        started on the network. It aims to develop fully competent VATSIM pilots, whether flying local
                        circuits or international routes, with training for procedures such as holds, visual circuits, and
                        the wide range of IFR approaches found across the world.</p>

                    <p>The programme consists of 3 different areas for members to engage with a mandatory Moodle course,
                        one-on-one sessions, and group sessions.</p>

                    <h3>The Moodle</h3>

                    <h4>Mandatory Section</h4>

                    <p>
                        The Flying Programme's Moodle is designed to expand upon and reinforce the principal topics found in
                        the P0 Online Pilot, with emphasis on UK-specifics. As such, completion of the Moodle and the
                        open-book assessment is mandatory for one-on-one and group flight sessions, which allows mentors to
                        focus on applying these concepts.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The IFR Moodle course contains the following topics:

                    <p>
                        The Moodle assessment is open book, with a time limit of 1 hour and a pass grade of 75%. The exam may
                        be retaken after a cooldown period, allowing you to revise the necessary areas.
                    </p>

                    <h3>One-on-One Sessions</h3>

                    <p>
                        One-on-one sessions can be requested via CTS once a member has been granted permissions by the
                        Initial Flight Instructor. Once a session is booked, the mentor will communicate with the student in
                        Discord to select a route and coordinate any further details for the session.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A student can request an <b>IFR route</b> of their choice, or recommended by the mentor.
                        These routes should have a short duration (around 1 hour) and relatively simple procedures.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Group Sessions</h3>

                    <h4>Group Flights</h4>

                    <p>
                        Group flights will be held periodically subject to demand and announced in the VATSIM UK Discord.
                        Members wishing to attend the group flight must enrol via CTS to be allocated a slot.
                        Members who have not enrolled via CTS are still welcome to attend the group flight
                        and be in the Discord channel.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Group flights will take place in the "tfp-group-flight" Discord channel with at least
                        one mentor present. The mentor is there to help everyone attending but will give priority to helping
                        members who booked via CTS.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Sign-Off</h3>

                    <p>
                        Members who have completed The Flying Programme will be announced weekly in the VATSIM UK Discord.
                        To quality, members will have to attend:

                                    One of the most important aspects of The Flying Programme is the involvement of ALL
                                    VATSIM UK members. As such, these are the requirements to become a mentor:
                                </p>
