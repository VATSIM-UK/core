                        aircraft around the world including the C152, C172, and P28A. Over the period of the course, you

                    <p>The IFR Pilot (P4) course is the first of 2 dedicated IFR pilot ratings. In this course you will
                        learn how to operate your selected aircraft under IFR rules, flying a SID, joining the airways,
                        following a STAR back down to earth and finally, fly a fully managed procedural ILS approach.
                        This
                        course allows you to fly any suitably equipped aircraft that has an FMS and coupled autopilot,
                        for
                        example, the A320 or B738. For this one, you will be based at East Midlands International
                        Airport
                        (EGNX) one of the UK’s most popular airports for commercial aircraft ‘base training’.</p>

                    procedures associated with flying under IFR in an unmanaged flight condition. The P5 rating must be
                    flown in a single or twin-engine propeller-driven aircraft, weighing under 5700kg. Fancy a
