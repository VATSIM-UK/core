                        The operations department has responsibility for creating, updating and maintaining software,
                        documentation and other resources to support the division. Broadly, most resources which fall
                        outside of either the ATC or pilot training systems are the responsibility of the Operations
                        Department.

                    <p>
                        Each AIRAC cycle (which occurs every 28 days), we release updates to the UK Sector File, UK
                        Controller Pack and many items of documentation or parts of the website. In addition to this, we
                        negotiate new cross-border procedures via Letters of Agreements (LoAs), propose and impliment
                        changes to ATC procedures domestically as well as support the other departments in the division
                        in executing their jobs.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In addition, this department is responsible for preparing the Region report and currently is
                        responsible for our Data related monitoring and compliance with relevant legislation.
