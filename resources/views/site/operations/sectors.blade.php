                    <p>
                        This page is to help pilots flying in UK airspace determine when they should contact one of our Area (CTR) sectors. We have tried to keep this as simple as possible, splitting the information into distinct sections depending on your type of flight.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you are ever unsure, please PM one of our controllers saying that you have read the website but are unsure whether you need to contact them. They will gladly advise!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Do not call</strong> EGTT_I_CTR or EGPX_I_CTR as civilian ‘airliner’ traffic – these positions are for Flight Information Services outside of controlled airspace only.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Do not call</strong> EGVV_CTR or EGQQ_CTR as a civilian ‘airliner’ – these positions are primarily for Military operations. UK FIS may be available on request/as coordinated with civilian area controllers (normally only above FL100).
                    </p>

                        What is top-down?
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        In the absence of local ATC, our area sectors provide a top-down service at airfields contained within the sector(s) they are controlling. You should request clearance, pushback, taxi etc. as you would if there were an aerodrome controller online.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Are all airfields covered top-down?</h3>

                    <p>
                        At airfields <strong>outside</strong> of <a href="https://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Controlled_Airspace#:~:text=SKYbrary%20Wiki,-If%20you%20wish&text=Controlled%20airspace%20is%20an%20airspace,accordance%20with%20the%20airspace%20classification." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                        controlled airspace</a> you may, if you wish, depart at your own discretion. However, if you intend to join
                        controlled airspace, it is generally advisable to request airways clearance from the controller <strong>prior</strong> to departure.
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                        How do I know who to call?
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        In the absence of local ATC, contact the first controller listed below that you see online (the priority is from left to right). Sometimes, the callsign may differ slightly, so it is best to cross-check the frequency too.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The location of these airports within our sectors are also marked on the diagrams in the next section.

                    <p>
                        We regularly split off the airspace in the London TMA area with LTC sectors, which are shown in the diagram below. There are 4 main sectors (NE, NW, SE, SW) which can be ‘bandboxed’ together using the LTC_N_CTR, LTC_S_CTR or LTC_CTR callsigns.

                    <p>
                        The top of these sectors is generally at FL155, up to a maximum of FL185.

                        If Scottish airspace is split any further, it will most likely be during events when lots of ATC is online to direct you between controllers, so do not worry.

                        If you are departing from an airfield <strong>inside</strong> controlled airspace, then you <strong>must</strong> obtain clearance for all stages of your departure from the relevant area controller, as set out in Section 1.

                    <p>
                        If you are departing from an airfield <strong>outside</strong> of controlled airspace, then you <strong>may</strong> ask the area controller directly above that airfield whether they are able to provide an air traffic service.

                    <p>
                        If you have departed from an airfield without speaking to ATC but wish to enter controlled airspace, you must obtain a clearance from the area controller that covers that airspace before doing so. Feel free to ask a controller whether they cover airspace if you are unsure.

                    <p>
                        Further splits require the remaining portion of the Primary or Secondary sector to be
                        staffed too - e.g. opening LTC_NE_CTR requires LTC_NW_CTR (as the remaining portion of
                        LTC_N_CTR) to be online.
