Military airfields are **not** covered *top-down* by the civilian Area (CTR) Control positions.

If local military ATC is online, you should contact them on the ground or if you are inbound.  
Otherwise, if **Swanwick Mil** is online, they can provide a service in all UK airspace and at military airports.

> **EGVV_CTR** (133.900) â€“ "Swanwick Mil"  
> Covers **EGTT and EGPX FIR** airspace and airports for military operations.

If you are departing from a military airfield and joining controlled airspace in the same way civilian air traffic does,  
you must get a **joining clearance** from the relevant civilian area sector **before you enter controlled airspace**.  
If you are unsure who to contact, please ask a controller or check [**VATGlasses**](https://vatglasses.uk/ukireland/).
