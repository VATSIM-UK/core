Our controllers will always send you a **contact me** if you are entering their airspace. However, you can use the diagrams below or [**VATGlasses**](https://vatglasses.uk/ukireland/) if you want to know when to call them in advance.

You should look up and plan for descent according to your expected **STAR**.  
You can also report your expected STAR on first contact to save time.  
If you need to descend before you enter an online controller’s airspace, then do so.

## London - Main Positions

The main London sector groups (**North**, **South**, **Central**, and **West**) are shown below.  
Sometimes these sectors are combined using the `LON_SC_CTR` or `LON_CTR` callsigns.

**Example:**

If `LON_CTR`, `LON_S_CTR`, and `LON_W_CTR` are online:

- <span style="color:red">**Red (North)**</span> — controlled by `LON_CTR`
- <span style="color:yellow">**Yellow (Central)**</span> — controlled by `LON_CTR`
- <span style="color:blue">**Blue (South)**</span> — controlled by `LON_S_CTR`
- <span style="color:green">**Green (West)**</span> — controlled by `LON_W_CTR`

## London - TMA Split Positions

We can also split off the airspace in the London area with **LTC** sectors.

There are four main sectors:

- **NE**
- **NW**
- **SE**
- **SW**

These may be combined using:

- `LTC_N_CTR`
- `LTC_S_CTR`
- `LTC_CTR`

**Key Points:**

- The top of these sectors is generally at **FL155**, but not above **FL195**.
- It is **especially important** to descend according to your STAR when **only LTC sectors are online**.
- Do **not wait** for a "contact me" before starting descent.

## Scottish - Main Positions

You will most often see `SCO_CTR`, which covers **all Scottish airspace**.  
The diagram below shows the two main **upper splits**.

- `STC_CTR`: Below **FL255** around the Scottish TMA, covering **EGPH**, **EGPF**, and **EGPK**.
- `STC_A_CTR`: Below **FL255** in the **Belfast area**, covering **EGAA** and **EGAC**.

Further Scottish splits may be used during events.
