If you are departing from an airfield as VFR, please see the section above — "I am departing from a UK airfield".

If you want to enter controlled airspace, you **must check** if any controller is covering that airspace.  
If yes, you need to get a **clearance before entering it**.

By using the **altitude slider** on [**VATGlasses**](https://vatglasses.uk/ukireland/), you can check for coverage.  
Feel free to ask a controller whether they cover airspace if you are unsure.

## London & Scottish Information

- **EGTT_I_CTR** (124.600) – "London Information"  
- **EGPX_I_CTR** (119.875) – "Scottish Information"

Both of these positions are able to provide a **Basic Service** to flights **outside of controlled airspace**.  
This is a type of UK Flight Information Service (UK FIS)  
(see page 71 of [*The Skyway Code*](https://publicapps.caa.co.uk/modalapplication.aspx?appid=11&mode=detail&id=7919)).

They are also able to arrange **airspace joining clearances** for IFR departures from airfields not covered top-down.
