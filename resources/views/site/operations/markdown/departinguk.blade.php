Always contact **local ATC** (DEL/GND/TWR/APP) where it is online. There are many APP positions that cover more than one airfield top-down:

- **EGAA_APP** – Belfast/Aldergrove (EGAA) and Belfast/City (EGAC)
- **EGGP_APP** – Liverpool (EGGP) and Hawarden (EGNR)
- **EGJJ_C_APP** – Jersey (EGJJ), Guernsey (EGJB), and Alderney (EGJA)
- **EGNO_APP** – Blackpool (EGNH) and Warton (EGNO)
- **EGNT_APP** – Newcastle (EGNT) and Teesside (EGNV)
- **ESSEX_APP** – London/Stansted (EGSS), London/Luton (EGGW), and Cambridge (EGSC)
- **EGSS_APP** – London/Stansted (EGSS) and Cambridge (EGSC)
- **SOLENT_APP** – Southampton (EGHI) and Bournemouth (EGHH)
- **THAMES_APP** – London/City (EGLC), Southend (EGMC), and Biggin Hill (EGKB)

### What is top-down?

In the absence of local ATC, area controllers provide a top-down service at airfields in their sectors. Request clearance, pushback, taxi, etc., as if there were an aerodrome controller online.

### Are all airfields covered top-down?

Controllers provide top-down service at all airfields with a permanent Tower or Approach facility in the real world, including airports [outside controlled airspace](https://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Controlled_Airspace#:~:text=SKYbrary%20Wiki,-If%20you%20wish&text=Controlled%20airspace%20is%20an%20airspace,accordance%20with%20the%20airspace%20classification.).

When busy, controllers may downgrade service at quieter airfields. You **must** contact the controller before departure to check the service provided.

If departing outside controlled airspace and joining it en route, ensure you obtain clearance beforehand.

### How do I know who to call?

When there is no local ATC, contact the first listed controller below that is online (left to right priority). Callsigns may vary, so always check the frequency.
