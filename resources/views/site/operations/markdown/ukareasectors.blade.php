### Introduction

This page explains the basics of the En Route (CTR) sectors in the UK. The information is split into sections for different stages of flight.

If you are ever unsure who to call, please message one of our controllers. They will be more than happy to help!

**Do not call** `EGTT_I_CTR` or `EGPX_I_CTR` as civilian ‘airliner’ traffic – these positions are for UK Flight Information Services (FIS) outside of controlled airspace only.

**Do not call** `EGVV_CTR` as a civilian ‘airliner’ – these positions are for Military operations. UK FIS may be available on request (normally only above FL100).

### Radio Callsigns

The two main radio callsigns for Area controllers in the UK are:

1. **"London Control"** – all LON and LTC callsigns  
2. **"Scottish Control"** – all SCO, STC and MAN callsigns
