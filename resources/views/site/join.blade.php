                        Flying and controlling on the VATSIM network is a great way to enjoy the perks of an interactive
                        flight simulation session, and making new friends along the way. To fly online, all you need is
                        a
                        copy of Flight Simulator or X Plane, and you're ready to go! For controlling, you don't need
                        anything except a working computer, all the software is provided free!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This page outlines step-by-step instructions on how to become a pilot or virtual air traffic
                        controller in the UK. Many of our members are both pilots and controllers, so feel free to give
                        them
                        both a try! If you have any problems during the process, please visit our forums or use the
                        "Contact
                        Us" function at the top of the page. If you are already a VATSIM member and want to transfer
                        into
                        the UK for controlling, please see the bottom of this page. Don't forget that VATSIM pilots can
                        fly
                        anywhere they want in the world without having to join our division, but if you primarily fly
                        here
                        in the UK you are encouraged to join our community to get the best experience you can.

                    <h4>Step 1</h4>
                    <p>Visit <a href="http://vatsim.net/">VATSIM.net</a> and register for your ID and password. This is a very quick process and is
                        completely FREE. Ensure you choose Europe as your region and the UK as your division.</p>

                    <p>If you are already a member of VATSIM, visit VATSIM Member Services and use the <a
                                href="https://cert.vatsim.net/vatsimnet/statcheck.html">ID status checker</a> to
                        verify
                        whether your home region/division is set to 'Europe - United Kingdom'. If not, you will need
                        to
                        make
                        an application to change to the UK in order to become a controller with us. Visit our 'Visit
                        or
                        Transfer' page for more information.</p>

                    <h4>Step 2</h4>
                    <p>Download a controller client such as EuroScope. You can use this to connect to VATSIM as an
                        Observer
                        (OBS), to observe proceedings but not yet to control live traffic yourself.</p>

                    <p>
                        Refer to <a href="{{ route('site.atc.newController') }}">Becoming a Controller</a> for
                        information on what to do next to get training for a
                        rating
                        upgrade to Student 1 and begin controlling some traffic!

                    <h4>Step 1</h4>
                    <p>Visit <a href="http://vatsim.net/">VATSIM.net</a> and register for your ID and password. This is a very quick process and is
                        completely FREE. Feel free to use Europe as your region and the UK as your division,
                        although you
                        can fly wherever you want on VATSIM, regardless of which country you choose to join.</p>

                    <h4>Step 2</h4>
                    <p>Download a recommended pilot client. These are the free pieces of software you will use to
                        connect
                        your flight simulator to VATSIM. If installing FSInn, you are strongly recommended to visit
                        <a href="http://forums.vatsim.net/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=20466">this
                            page</a> for instructions on how to achieve best results.</p>

                    <h4>Step 3</h4>
                    <p>Visit the <a href="http://www.vatsim.net/pilots/quickstart/">Quick Start Guide</a> and <a href="http://www.vatsim.net/prc/">Pilot Resource Center</a> to get started as a pilot on the
                        network. For
                        flying in the UK, our own <a href="#">Pilot Information Center</a> contains some great information and
                        resources.</p>

                    <h4>Step 4</h4>
                    <p>Consider joining a <a href="http://ptd.vatsim.net/">Pilot Training Program</a> to enhance your pilot skills or join a
                        distinguished
                        virtual airline like BA Virtual. If you prefer GA flying, you might like to consider
                        visiting the
                        <a href="http://www.cixvfrclub.org.uk/">CIX VFR Club</a>.</p>

                    <h4>Step 5</h4>
                    <p>Get online and fly!</p>
