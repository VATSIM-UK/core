## Section 3 | Block Training
S2 Training now encompasses a block training system to homogenise the Tower training process and ensure
that all competencies are covered to a sufficient standard.

Students will complete all blocks before being forwarded for a practical exam unless an exception is required
(e.g. fast tracks). The system is split into two blocks: 
- Block 1 - Basic Training
- Block 2 - Consolidation and Network Practice.

Each block allows for students to practise and develop the skills needed to control Tower positions in the UK.
Training will conclude with a practical exam in which students will be assessed against the competencies as
set out in the VATSIM.net Global Controller Administration Policy (GCAP). Upon a successful completion of
the practical examination, they will be rewarded with an S2 rating.

### 3.1 Block 1 - Basic Training (TWR_BTRG)
During this section, students will complete a group seminar and a series of 2 sweatbox sessions.
In these 2 sessions, they will get the opportunity to practise all the skills required to
be a TWR controller in the UK on the sweatbox server in a one-to-one environment with a
mentor. Mentoring sessions will be mainly focused on the practical aspects of controlling.

To accompany practical sessions, each lesson during this block has an associated lesson on
Moodle. Students must complete the Moodle lessons in sequential order and it is strongly
recommend that students only move on to the next lesson once they are confident in all
areas of theory in the previous lesson.

### 3.1.1 Self Study
Students are expected to attend each session with a good knowledge of the relevant theory.
Sessions may be concluded early or rescheduled to another time should the student lack the
pre-requisite knowledge.

Turning up to sessions prepared ensures that students obtain the most out of each session
while also ensuring that mentors time is utilised efficiently.

We expect that the amount of self-study needed will be much higher than during the second
block. Although the actual amount of time needed will vary from person to person, we
expect you to commit roughly ‘time twice’ to self-study - this means for each 1.5-hour
mentoring session, you should spend another 1.5 hours consolidating your knowledge and
preparing for your next session.

### 3.2 Block 2 - Consolidation and Network Practice
During Block 2, students will have multiple one-to-one mentoring sessions that are focussed
on consolidating the skills learnt during Block 1, specifically applying them to network traffic.

Mentors are to cater what is covered in these sessions to the strengths and weaknesses of
the student.

For most students, who actively participate in sessions and partake in regular self-study, we
expect this block to consist of 5 to 9 sessions

### 3.2.1 Solo Tower Validation (STV)
As students near the end of training, they may be issued with a Solo Tower Validation. This is
a time-limited endorsement which allows students to control solo on the position on which
they are training. Validations will have a maximum length of 30 days from the mentoring
session in which it was recommended. Throughout tower training, a student may only have a
maximum of 90 days of solo validations.

### 3.2.2 Self Study
During this block, self-study is still of high importance. By this point, students should already
have a good knowledge of:
- All the theory material for S2 training.
- The vMATS Pt.2 of their designated aerodrome.

Most of the student’s self-study should be spent keeping this knowledge up to date and
revising any topics that they may have struggled with in your previous mentoring sessions.

### 3.3 End of Block 2 Exam (TWR_B2)
The End of Block Exam is designed as a training checkpoint aimed to assess the capabilities
of the student before moving onto the next training block. The End of Block 2 Exam is
considered a mock exam before students are forwarded for their practical examination.

It should be performed on the live network (preferred) or the Sweatbox server. The decision
of exam environment (network or sweatbox) should take into consideration traffic levels at
the aerodrome at that time of day. If the student is deemed ready for the exam, the TGIs will
forward the student in the relevant channel.

## Section 4 | Block 1 (Basic Training) Lesson Plans
The lesson plans presented below should be taught to students in the order that they are presented in this
document. At the end of each lesson, if a learning objective/aim has not been covered or met, mentors are
requested to note this in the ‘additional comments’ box of the mentoring report.

Occasionally, it can be advantageous to revisit a particular lesson or a series of lessons, or to integrate and
consolidate different lessons. Mentors are encouraged to do this where it is beneficial to do so.

### 4.1 Lesson One - Group Seminar
This group session is designed to allow TG Leads to cover the basic, generic S2 competencies
in a group session rather than individual 1-1 sessions. The session will endeavour to cover
the expectations of students during training - namely students’ engagement, self-study and
progression.
