# S1 Syllabus and Lesson Plans

**Version 1.0**
**Effective Date:** 01st November 2025

---

## Section 1 | Scope

This document outlines the syllabus and lesson structure for VATSIM United Kingdom Division Observer to Student 1 controller training (OBS-S1).

## Section 2 | Grading

In a mentoring report, a student will be graded in accordance with the rubric in this section.
The rubric approximately follows the first five objectives from the cognitive domain of Bloom's Taxonomy:

- Remember
- Understand
- Apply
- Analyse
- Evaluate

Not every student will precisely fit the definition for a single grade. The mentor's judgement and experience will be needed to decide which grade to award for a given competency.

Before submission for practical examination, a student must have passed the S1 theory exam, have reached 'Good' in all competencies, and should have reached 'Test Standard' in most competencies.

Alongside the guidance in other sections of this syllabus, mentors and instructors will need to use their judgement and experience to decide when it is appropriate to submit a student for practical examination.

| Grade | Description |
| :---: | :--- |
| Not covered | The student has not covered this competency. |
| Covered | Key facts and concepts can be recalled, with some understanding shown. If the student has demonstrated pracical application, it will be with significant mentor input. |
| Developing | Knowledge is satisfactorily applied to practical situations with some mentor input. A strong understanding is shown, either explicity, or implicitly. |
| Good | Routine situations are handled with little mentor input; more uncommon situations are handled with some mentor input. Understanding of multiple competencies is integrated either explicity or implicitly. |
| Test standard | Most situations are handled with minimal mentor input. Appropriate consideration is given to the long term effects of actions. Decisions can be justified with an explaination as to why they chose to take it rather than an alternative. |

## Section 5 | Lesson Plans

The lesson plans presented below should be taught to students in the order that they are presented in this document. At the end of each lesson, if a learning objective/aim has not been covered or met, mentors are requested to note this in the 'additional comments' box of the mentoring report.

There are times where it may be beneficial to repeat a specific lesson or set of lessons, or combine lessons. Mentors are encouraged to do this where it is beneficial to do so.

At the beginning of each session, whether it is one of the lessons in this document, or an ad-hoc lesson, outline to the student what the objectives of the lesson are, and how we intend to achive them. This may include running though the 'Aims' section of the lesson plan. This may also be a simple recognition that the purpose of the lesson is to get a feel for where the student is, or to see what issue arise in the session. Nevertheless, the importance of a clear brief cannot be stressed enough.

After the completion of lesson 4, a student should be in a good position to pass their exam. If further lessons are required after the completion of lesson 4, mentors should list the aims of any further ad-hoc mentoring sessions in the 'additional comments' box.

These lessons have been designed to be used in conjunction with a specific SweatBox file, listed at the top of each lesson. Each lesson has different objectives that must be met in order to complete the lesson.

The SweatBox files contain deliberate mistakes that can be used to demonstrate selected areas of the syllabus, and ultimately achieve the objectives set out for each lesson. For example, some aircraft in lesson 2 have flight planning errors in their routing, RFL, and initial fix.

As a mentor, you can use the aircraft in the SweatBoxes to help you demonstrate the objectives of the lesson to the student. Some objectives may not be met practically, and therefore should be taught in the theory section of the session.
